              "2  >\\n\\n  Based on the provided context, there is no information given about the change in investment banking fees for the third quarter of 2023 compared to the third quarter of 2022. The text only mentions that earnings performance for the third quarter of 2023 showed a decrease in revenue driven by lower other noninterest income reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of the company's Visa B common stock exposure, as well as lower venture capital revenue. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2023 decreased due to lower operating losses resulting from lower expenses for legal actions. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue increased due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities, lower other noninterest income, and lower net gains from debt securities. Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to lower operating losses resulting from lower expenses for legal actions and the impact of previously divested businesses. No specific information is provided about investment banking fees for either the third quarter or the first nine months of 2023 compared to the corresponding periods in 2022.   \n",

The text only mentions that earnings performance for the third quarter of 2023 showed a decrease in revenue driven by lower other noninterest income reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of the company's Visa B common stock exposure, as well as lower venture capital revenue. Noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2023 decreased due to lower operating losses resulting from lower expenses for legal actions. For the first nine months of 2023, revenue increased due to higher net interest income, partially offset by lower unrealized and realized gains on nonmarketable equity securities, lower other noninterest income, and lower net gains from debt securities. Noninterest expense for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to lower operating losses resulting from lower expenses for legal actions and the impact of previously divested businesses. No specific information is provided about investment banking fees for either the third quarter or the first nine months of 2023 compared to the corresponding periods in 2022.   \n",
