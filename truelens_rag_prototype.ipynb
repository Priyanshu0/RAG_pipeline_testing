See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used \\nthroughout this Report. \\nFinancial Review \\nOverview \\nWells Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \\nthat has approximately $1.9 trillion in assets. We provide a \\ndiversified set of banking, investment and mortgage products \\nand services, as well as consumer and commercial finance, \\nthrough our four reportable operating segments: Consumer \\nBanking and Lending, Commercial Banking, Corporate and \\nInvestment Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management. \\nWells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 rankings of \\nAmerica’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in assets and \\nthird in the market value of our common stock among all U.S. \\nbanks at December 31, 2023. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, some of which are described below. These \\nregulatory actions may require the Company, among other \\nthings, to undertake certain changes to its business, operations, \\nproducts and services, and risk management practices. \\nAddressing these regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \\nyears, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \\nalong the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \\nto continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \\ncontrol infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \\nactions. Regulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues or \\nhave repeat issues. Furthermore, issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others. Failure to \\nsatisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis \\ncould result in additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, \\nlimitations on subsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or \\nliquidity requirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \\nconsequences, which could be significant. While we still have \\nsignificant work to do and have not yet satisfied certain aspects \\nof these regulatory actions, the Company is committed to \\ndevoting the resources necessary to operate with strong \\nbusiness practices and controls, maintain the highest level of \\nintegrity, and have an appropriate culture in place. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the \\nCompany’s compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the Company works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are adopted and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \\nlock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide compliance \\nrisk management plan and a plan to enhance the Company’s \\ninternal audit program with respect to federal consumer financial \\nlaw and the terms of the consent orders. In addition, as required \\nby the consent orders, the Company submitted for non-\\nobjection plans to remediate customers affected by the \\nautomobile collateral protection insurance and mortgage \\ninterest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the management \\nof remediation activities conducted by the Company. The \\nCompany continues to work to address the provisions of the \\nconsent orders. On September 9, 2021, the OCC assessed a \\n$250 million civil money penalty against the Company related to \\ninsufficient progress in addressing requirements under the OCC’s \\nApril 2018 consent order and loss mitigation activities in the \\nCompany’s Home Lending business. On December 20, 2022, the \\nCFPB modified its consent order to clarify how it would \\nterminate. \\n4 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In addition, the consent \\norder restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nresidential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \\nmortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \\nCompany’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \\nprovided. \\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \\nLending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \\nLending \\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \\norder with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \\nremediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \\nconsumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \\npractices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \\nrefunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \\nprotection agreements; comply with certain business practice \\nrequirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \\n$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired. On \\nFebruary 15, 2024, the OCC announced the termination of its \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \\nhad $819 million and $2.3 billion of accrued liabilities for \\ncustomer remediation activities as of December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. As our ongoing reviews continue and as we \\ncontinue to strengthen our risk and control infrastructure, we \\nhave identified and may in the future identify additional items or \\nareas of potential concern. To the extent issues are identified, we \\nwill continue to assess any customer harm and provide \\nremediation as appropriate. Recent Developments \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \\nIn November 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \\n(FDIC) finalized a rule to recover losses to the FDIC deposit \\ninsurance fund as a result of bank failures in the first half of 2023. \\nUnder the rule, the FDIC will collect a special assessment based \\non a calculation using an insured depository institution’s (IDI) \\nestimated amount of uninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s \\nfinalization of the rule, we expensed the entire estimated amount \\nof our special assessment of $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be \\npaid over eight quarters beginning in June 2024. The amount of \\nour special assessment may change as the FDIC determines the \\nactual losses to the deposit insurance fund and evaluates any \\namendments by IDIs to uninsured deposit amounts reported for \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nOverdraft Fees Proposal \\nOn January 17, 2024, the CFPB issued a proposed rule that would \\nlimit overdraft fees charged by certain banks. We expect a \\nsignificant reduction to our overdraft fees, which are included in \\ndeposit-related fees, if the rule is adopted as currently proposed. \\nDebit Card Interchange Fees Proposal \\nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \\nreduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \\ndebit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \\nan update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \\nbased on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \\nissuers. We expect a significant reduction to our debit card \\ninterchange fees, which are included in card fees, if the rule is \\nadopted as currently proposed. \\nCapital Matters \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \\nrule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would \\nimpact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \\naddress the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \\nand capital optimization strategies. \\nFor additional information about capital planning, see the \\n“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” \\nsection in this Report. \\nWells Fargo & Company 5 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The net interest margin is the \\naverage yield on earning assets minus the average interest rate \\npaid for deposits and our other sources of funding. \\nNet interest income and the net interest margin in any one \\nperiod can be significantly affected by a variety of factors \\nincluding the mix and overall size of our earning assets portfolio \\nand the cost of funding those assets. In addition, variable sources \\nof interest income, such as loan fees, periodic dividends, and \\ncollection of interest on nonaccrual loans, can fluctuate from \\nperiod to period. Net interest income and net interest margin increased in \\n2023, compared with 2022, driven by the impact of higher \\ninterest rates, which resulted in both higher interest income on \\ninterest-earning assets and higher interest expense for interest-\\nbearing deposits and long-term debt . \\nTable 3 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and net interest margin. Net interest income and net \\ninterest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in \\nTable 3 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-\\nexempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% \\nfederal statutory tax rate for the periods ended December 31, \\n2023, 2022 and 2021. \\nWells Fargo & Company 9 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 8. We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing   Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing   When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. We periodically assess and update our revenue \\nand expense allocation methodologies. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments   Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and updated. Effective January 1, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment’s use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\noperating segments or lines of business. \\nTable 8:   Management Reporting Structure \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nConsumer \\nBanking and \\nLending Commercial \\nBanking Corporate and \\nInvestment \\nBanking Wealth and \\nInvestment \\nManagement Corporate \\n• Consumer, Small \\nand Business \\nBanking \\n• Home Lending \\n• Credit Card \\n• Auto \\n• Personal Lending • Middle Market \\nBanking \\n• Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing • Banking \\n• Commercial Real \\nEstate \\n• Markets • Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors \\n• The Private \\nBank • Corporate \\nTreasury \\n• Enterprise \\nFunctions \\n• Investment \\nPortfolio \\n• Venture capital \\nand private equity \\ninvestments \\n• Non-strategic \\nbusinesses Earnings Performance (continued) \\n14 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The size and composition of our AFS and \\nHTM debt securities is dependent upon the Company’s liquidity \\nand interest rate risk management objectives. The AFS debt \\nsecurities portfolio can be used to meet funding needs that arise \\nin the normal course of business or due to market stress. \\nChanges in our interest rate risk profile may occur due to changes \\nin overall economic or market conditions, which could influence \\nloan origination demand, prepayment rates, or deposit balances \\nand mix. In response, the AFS debt securities portfolio can be \\nrebalanced to meet the Company’s interest rate risk \\nmanagement objectives. In addition to meeting liquidity and \\ninterest rate risk management objectives, the AFS and HTM debt \\nsecurities portfolios may provide yield enhancement over other \\nshort-term assets. See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \\nManagement” section in this Report for additional information \\non liquidity and interest rate risk. \\nThe AFS debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of \\nliquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and \\nagency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). The portfolio also \\nincludes securities issued by U.S. states and political subdivisions \\nand highly rated collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). \\nThe HTM debt securities portfolio predominantly consists of \\nliquid, high-quality U.S. Treasury and federal agency debt, and \\nagency MBS. The portfolio also includes securities issued by U.S. \\nstates and political subdivisions and highly rated CLOs. Debt \\nsecurities are classified as HTM at the time of purchase or when \\ntransferred from the AFS debt securities portfolio. Our intent is \\nto hold these securities to maturity and collect the contractual \\ncash flows. In first quarter 2023, we changed our intent with \\nrespect to certain HTM debt securities and reclassified them to \\nAFS debt securities in connection with the adoption of ASU \\n2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair Value \\nHedging – Portfolio Layer Method. For additional information on \\nour adoption of ASU 2022-01, see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport. The amortized cost, net of the allowance for credit losses, of \\nAFS and HTM debt securities decreased from December 31, \\n2022. Purchases of AFS and HTM debt securities were more than \\noffset by paydowns and maturities, as well as sales of AFS debt \\nsecurities. We reclassified HTM debt securities with an aggregate \\nfair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost of $23.9 billion to \\nAFS debt securities in 2023 in connection with the adoption of \\nASU 2022-01 . In addition, we transferred AFS debt securities \\nwith a fair value of $3.7 billion to HTM debt securities in 2023 \\ndue to actions taken to reposition the overall portfolio for capital \\nmanagement purposes. Debt securities transferred from AFS to \\nHTM in 2023 had $320 million of pre-tax unrealized losses at the \\ntime of the transfers. \\nThe total net unrealized losses on AFS and HTM debt \\nsecurities decreased from December 31, 2022, due to changes in \\ninterest rates. \\nAt December 31, 2023, 99% of the combined AFS and HTM \\ndebt securities portfolio was rated AA- or above.

Risk is the possibility of an \\nevent occurring that could adversely affect the Company’s ability \\nto achieve its strategic and business objectives. The Company \\nroutinely takes risks to achieve its business goals and to serve its \\ncustomers. These risks include financial risks, such as interest \\nrate, credit, liquidity, and market risks, and non-financial risks, \\nsuch as operational (which includes compliance and model risks), \\nstrategic and reputation risks. \\nRisk Profile.   The Company’s risk profile is an assessment of the \\naggregate risks associated with the Company’s exposures and \\nbusiness activities after taking into consideration risk \\nmanagement effectiveness. The Company monitors its risk \\nprofile, and the Board reviews risk profile reports and analysis. \\nRisk Capacity.   Risk capacity is the maximum level of risk that \\nthe Company could assume given its current level of resources \\nbefore triggering regulatory and other constraints on its capital \\nand liquidity needs. \\nRisk Appetite.   Risk appetite is the nature and level of risk the \\nCompany is willing to take, within its risk capacity, while pursuing \\nits strategic and business objectives. Risk appetite is articulated \\nin our Statement of Risk Appetite, which establishes acceptable \\nrisks and at what level and includes risk appetite principles. The \\nCompany’s Statement of Risk Appetite is defined by senior \\nmanagement, approved at least annually by the Board, and helps \\nguide the Company’s business and risk leaders. The Company \\ncontinuously monitors its risk appetite, and the Board reviews \\nreports which include risk appetite information and analysis. \\nRisk and Strategy.   The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) drives the \\nCompany’s strategic planning process, which identifies the \\nCompany’s most significant opportunities and challenges, \\ndevelops plans to address them, evaluates the risks of those \\nplans, and articulates the resulting decisions in the form of a \\ncompany-wide strategic plan. The Company’s risk profile, risk \\ncapacity, risk appetite, and risk management effectiveness are \\nconsidered in the strategic planning process, which is linked with \\nthe Company’s capital planning process. The Company’s \\nIndependent Risk Management (IRM) organization participates \\nin strategic planning, providing challenge to and independent \\nassessment of the risks associated with strategic initiatives. IRM \\nalso independently assesses and challenges the impact of the \\nstrategic plan on risk capacity, risk appetite, and risk \\nmanagement effectiveness at the principal lines of business, \\nenterprise functions, and aggregate Company levels. The \\nstrategic plan is presented to the Board each year with IRM’s \\nevaluation. \\nRisk and Climate Change.   The Company views climate change as \\na global challenge that presents significant impacts for \\nbusinesses and communities around the world. The Company \\nexpects that climate change will increasingly impact the risk \\ntypes it manages, and the Company continues to integrate \\nclimate considerations into its risk management framework as its \\nunderstanding of climate change and risks driven by it evolve. Risk is Managed by Everyone.   Every employee, in the course of \\ntheir daily activities, creates risk and is responsible for managing \\nrisk. Every employee has a role to play in risk management, \\nincluding establishing and maintaining the Company’s risk and \\ncontrol environment. Every employee must comply with \\napplicable laws, regulations, and Company policies. \\nRisk and Culture.   Senior management sets the tone at the top \\nby supporting a strong culture, defined by the Company’s \\nexpectations and Code of Conduct, that guides how employees \\nconduct themselves and make decisions. The Board is \\nresponsible for holding senior management accountable for \\nestablishing and maintaining this culture and effectively \\nmanaging risk. Senior management expects employees to speak \\nup when they see something that could cause harm to the \\nCompany’s customers, communities, employees, shareholders, \\nor reputation. Because risk management is everyone’s \\nresponsibility, all employees are empowered to and expected to \\nchallenge risk decisions when appropriate and to escalate their \\nconcerns when they have not been addressed. The Company’s \\nperformance management and incentive compensation \\nprograms are designed to establish a balanced framework for risk \\nand reward under core principles that employees are expected to \\nknow and practice. The Board, through its Human Resources \\nCommittee, plays an important role in overseeing and providing \\ncredible challenge to the Company’s performance management \\nand incentive compensation programs. Effective risk \\nmanagement is a central component of employee performance \\nevaluations. \\nRisk Management Framework.

The Company has \\nestablished management committees, including those focused \\non risk, that support management in carrying out its governance \\nand risk management responsibilities. One type of management \\ncommittee is a governance committee, which is a decision-\\nmaking body that operates for a particular purpose and may \\nreport to a Board committee. \\nEach management governance committee, in accordance \\nwith its charter, is expected to discuss, document, and make \\ndecisions regarding high priority and significant risks, emerging risks, risk acceptances, and risks and issues escalated to it; review \\nand monitor progress related to critical and high-risk issues and \\nremediation efforts, including lessons learned; and report key \\nchallenges, decisions, escalations, other actions, and open issues \\nas appropriate. \\nTable 15 presents, as of December 31, 2023, the structure \\nof the Company’s Board committees and escalation paths of \\nrelevant management governance committees reporting to a \\nBoard committee. \\nTable 15:   Board and Relevant Management-level Governance Committee Structure \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nAudit \\nCommittee (1) Finance \\nCommittee Corporate \\nResponsibility \\nCommittee Risk \\nCommittee Governance & \\nNominating \\nCommittee Human \\nResources \\nCommittee \\nManagement Governance Committees \\nDisclosure \\nCommittee Capital \\nManagement \\nCommittee Allowance for Credit \\nLosses Approval \\nGovernance \\nCommittee Enterprise Risk & \\nControl Committee Incentive \\nCompensation \\n& Performance \\nManagement \\nCommittee \\nRegulatory \\nReporting \\nOversight \\nCommittee Corporate \\nAsset/Liability \\nCommittee Risk & Control \\nCommittees \\nRecovery & \\nResolution \\nCommittee Risk Type \\nCommittees \\nRisk Topic \\nCommittees \\n(1) The Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s financial statements and disclosures to shareholders and regulatory agencies; oversees the internal audit function and \\nexternal auditor independence, activities, and performance; and assists the Board and the Risk Committee in the oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. \\nManagement Governance Committees Reporting to the Risk \\nCommittee of the Board.   The Enterprise Risk & Control \\nCommittee (ERCC) is a decision-making and escalation body that \\ngoverns the management of all risk types. The ERCC receives \\ninformation about risk and control issues, addresses escalated \\nrisks and issues, and actively oversees risk controls. The ERCC \\nalso makes decisions related to significant risks and changes to \\nthe Company’s risk appetite. The Risk Committee receives \\nregular updates from the ERCC chairs and senior management \\nregarding current and emerging risks and senior management’s \\nassessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s risk \\nmanagement program. \\nThe ERCC is co-chaired by the CEO and CRO, with   \\nmembership comprising the heads of principal lines of business \\nand certain enterprise functions. The Chief Auditor or a designee \\nattends all meetings of the ERCC. The ERCC has a direct \\nescalation path to the Risk Committee. The ERCC also has an \\nescalation path for certain human capital risks and issues to the \\nHuman Resources Committee. In addition, the CRO may escalate \\ndirectly to the Board. Risks and issues are escalated to the ERCC \\nin accordance with the Company’s escalation management \\npolicy. \\nEach principal line of business and enterprise function has a \\nrisk and control committee, which is a management governance \\ncommittee with a mandate that aligns with the ERCC but with its \\nscope limited to the respective principal line of business or enterprise function. These committees focus on and consider \\nrisks that the respective principal line of business or enterprise \\nfunction generate and manage, and the controls the principal line \\nof business or enterprise function are expected to have in place. \\nAs a complement to these risk and control committees, \\nmanagement governance committees dedicated to specific risk \\ntypes and risk topics also report to the ERCC to enable more \\ncomprehensive governance of risks. \\nRisk Operating Model – Roles and Responsibilities \\nThe Company has three lines of defense for managing risk: the \\nFront Line, Independent Risk Management, and Internal Audit. \\n• Front Line The Front Line, which comprises principal line of \\nbusiness and certain enterprise function activities, is the first \\nline of defense. The Front Line is responsible for \\nunderstanding the risks generated by its activities, applying \\nadequate controls, and managing risk in the course of its \\nbusiness activities. The Front Line identifies, measures and \\nassesses, controls, monitors, and reports on risk generated \\nby or associated with its business activities and balances risk \\nand reward in decision making while operating within the \\nCompany’s risk appetite. \\n• Independent Risk Management IRM is the second line of \\ndefense.

We \\ngenerally subject commercial and industrial loans and lease \\nfinancing to individual risk assessment using our internal \\nborrower and collateral quality ratings. Our ratings are aligned to \\nregulatory definitions of pass and criticized categories with \\ncriticized segmented among special mention, substandard, \\ndoubtful, and loss categories. \\nWe had $14.6 billion of the commercial and industrial loans \\nand lease financing portfolio internally classified as criticized in \\naccordance with regulatory guidance at December 31, 2023, \\ncompared with $12.6 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase \\nwas driven by the technology, telecom and media, and retail \\nindustries. \\nThe majority of our commercial and industrial loans and \\nlease financing portfolio is secured by short-term assets, such as \\naccounts receivable, inventory and debt securities, as well as \\nlong-lived assets, such as equipment and other business assets. \\nGenerally, the primary source of repayment for this portfolio is \\nthe operating cash flows of customers, with the collateral \\nsecuring this portfolio representing a secondary source of \\nrepayment. \\nThe portfolio decreased at December 31, 2023, compared \\nwith December 31, 2022, as a result of paydowns and decreased \\nloan draws.

In cases where the value of \\ncollateral or financial condition of the borrower is insufficient to \\nrepay our loan, we may rely upon the support of an outside \\nrepayment guarantee in providing the extension. \\nOur ability to seek performance under a guarantee is directly \\nrelated to the guarantor’s creditworthiness, capacity and \\nwillingness to perform, which is evaluated on an annual basis, or \\nmore frequently as warranted. Our evaluation is based on the \\nmost current financial information available and is focused on \\nvarious key financial metrics, including net worth, leverage, and \\ncurrent and future liquidity. We consider the guarantor’s \\nreputation, creditworthiness, and willingness to work with us \\nbased on our analysis, as well as other lenders’ experience with \\nthe guarantor. Our assessment of the guarantor’s credit strength \\nis reflected in our loan risk ratings for such loans. The loan risk \\nrating and accruing status are important factors in our allowance \\nfor credit losses methodology. \\nIn considering the accrual status of the loan, we evaluate \\nthe collateral and future cash flows, as well as the anticipated \\nsupport of any repayment guarantor. In many cases, the \\nstrength of the guarantor provides sufficient assurance that full \\nrepayment of the loan is expected. When full and timely \\ncollection of the loan becomes uncertain, including the \\nperformance of the guarantor, we place the loan on nonaccrual \\nstatus. As appropriate, we also charge the loan down in \\naccordance with our charge-off policies, generally to the net \\nrealizable value of the collateral securing the loan, if any. COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE (CRE) Our CRE loan portfolio is \\ncomposed of CRE mortgage and CRE construction loans. The \\ntotal CRE loan portfolio decreased $5.2 billion from \\nDecember 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and \\nadvances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by \\nproperty type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE \\nloans are in California, New York, Florida, and Texas, which \\nrepresented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The \\nlargest property type concentrations are apartments at 28% and \\noffice at 21% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments at \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022 were $7.7 billion and $8.8 billion, \\nrespectively, for CRE mortgage loans and $13.2 billion and \\n$20.7 billion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. \\nWe generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment \\nusing our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had \\n$17.5 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at \\nDecember 31, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2022, and $830 million of CRE construction loans \\nclassified as criticized at December 31, 2023, compared with \\n$1.1 billion at December 31, 2022. The increase in criticized CRE \\nmortgage loans was predominantly driven by the office and \\napartments property types. The credit quality of the office \\nproperty type continued to be adversely affected as weakened \\ndemand for office space continued to drive higher vacancy rates \\nand deteriorating operating performance. Loans in California and \\nNew York represented approximately 40% of the office property \\ntype at December 31, 2023.

We monitor exposures \\nclosely and adjust our country limits in response to changing \\nconditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure \\nbased on our assessment of a borrower’s ability to repay, which gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as \\nguarantees and collateral, and may be different from the \\nreporting based on a borrower’s primary address. \\nOur largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at \\nDecember 31, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled \\n$27.8 billion, or approximately 1% of our total assets, and \\nincluded $4.1 billion of sovereign claims.

Residential mortgage – first lien loans represented 96% of \\nthe total residential mortgage loan portfolio at December 31, \\n2023, compared with 95% at December 31, 2022. \\nThe residential mortgage loan portfolio includes loans with \\nadjustable-rate features. We monitor the risk of default as a \\nresult of interest rate increases on adjustable-rate mortgage \\n(ARM) loans, which may be mitigated by product features that \\nlimit the amount of the increase in the contractual interest rate. \\nThe default risk of these loans is considered in our ACL for loans. \\nARM loans were 7% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 \\nand 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for the \\nmajority of this portfolio at December 31, 2023.

Junior lien loan products are primarily amortizing \\npayment loans with fixed interest rates and repayment periods \\nbetween five to 30 years. We continuously monitor the credit performance of our residential mortgage – junior lien portfolio \\nfor trends and factors that influence the frequency and severity \\nof losses, such as junior lien performance when the first lien loan \\nis delinquent. \\nThe outstanding balance of residential mortgage lines of \\ncredit was $15.0 billion at December 31, 2023, compared with \\n$18.3 billion at December 31, 2022. The unfunded credit \\ncommitments for these lines of credit totaled $28.6 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2023, compared with $35.5 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2022. Our residential mortgage lines of credit \\n(both first and junior lien) generally have draw periods of 10, 15 \\nor 20 years with variable interest rate and payment options \\navailable during the draw period of (1) interest-only or (2) 1.5% \\nof outstanding principal balance plus accrued interest. The lines \\nthat enter their amortization period may experience higher \\ndelinquencies and higher loss rates than the ones in their draw or \\nterm period. We have considered this increased risk in our ACL \\nfor loans estimate. Interest-only lines and loans were \\napproximately 2% of total loans at both December 31, 2023 and \\n2022. \\nDuring the draw period, the borrower has the option of \\nconverting all or a portion of the line from a variable interest rate \\nto a fixed rate.

In \\naddition, we pool FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential \\nmortgage loans that are then used to back securities guaranteed \\nby the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). We \\nmay be required to repurchase these mortgage loans, indemnify \\nthe securitization trust, investor or insurer, or reimburse the \\nsecuritization trust, investor or insurer for credit losses incurred \\non loans (collectively, repurchase) in the event of a breach of \\ncontractual representations or warranties that is not remedied \\nwithin a period (usually 90 days or less) after we receive notice of \\nthe breach. \\nIn connection with our sales and securitization of residential \\nmortgage loans, we have established a mortgage repurchase \\nliability, initially at fair value, related to various representations \\nand warranties that reflect management’s estimate of losses for \\nloans for which we could have a repurchase obligation, whether or \\nnot we currently service those loans, based on a combination of \\nfactors. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \\nEntities) to Financial Statements in this Report for additional \\ninformation about our liability for mortgage loan repurchase \\nlosses. \\nWe provide recourse to GSEs for commercial mortgage \\nloans sold under various programs and arrangements. The terms \\nof certain programs require that we incur a pro-rata share of \\nactual losses in the event of borrower default. See Note 17 \\n(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \\nin this Report for additional information about our exposure to \\nloss related to these programs. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \\nmortgage loans included in GSE mortgage securitizations, \\nGNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of FHA-insured/ \\nVA-guaranteed mortgages and private label mortgage \\nsecuritizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans owned by \\ninstitutional investors. \\nThe loans we service were originated by us or by other \\nmortgage loan originators. As servicer, our primary duties are \\ntypically to (1) collect payments due from borrowers, (2) advance \\ncertain delinquent payments of principal and interest on the \\nmortgage loans, (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title or \\nprimary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage \\nloans, (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of \\ntaxes and insurance and administer escrow payments, and (5) \\nforeclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent \\nconsistent with the related servicing agreement, consider \\nalternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short \\nsales, and for certain investors, manage the foreclosed property \\nthrough liquidation. As master servicer, our primary duties are \\ntypically to (1) supervise, monitor and oversee the servicing of \\nthe mortgage loans by the servicer, and (2) advance delinquent \\namounts required by non-affiliated servicers who fail to perform \\ntheir advancing obligations. The amount and timing of \\nreimbursement for advances of delinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable servicing agreements. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information about residential and \\ncommercial servicing rights, servicer advances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \\ncertain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \\nbased on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \\npayments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \\nliability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to \\nrepurchase the loan. We may repurchase these loans for cash and \\nas a result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \\nLoans repurchased from GNMA securitization pools that \\nregain current status or are otherwise modified in accordance \\nwith applicable servicing guidelines may be included in future \\nGNMA loan securitization pools. At December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, these loans, which we have repurchased or have the \\nunilateral option to repurchase, were $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion, \\nrespectively, which included $7.4 billion and $8.6 billion, \\nrespectively, in loans held for investment, with the remainder in \\nloans held for sale. See Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable \\nInterest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report for \\nadditional information about our involvement with mortgage \\nloan securitizations. \\nEach agreement under which we act as servicer or master \\nservicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for \\nactions we take in such capacity. We are required to indemnify \\nthe securitization trustee against any failure by us, as servicer or \\nmaster servicer, to perform our servicing obligations. In addition, \\nif we commit a breach of our obligations as servicer or master \\nservicer, we may be subject to termination if the breach is not \\ncured within a specified period. The standards governing \\nservicing in GSE-guaranteed securitizations, and the possible \\nremedies for violations of such standards, vary, and those \\nstandards and remedies are determined by servicing guides \\nmaintained by the GSEs, contracts between the GSEs and \\nindividual servicers and topical guides published by the GSEs \\nfrom time to time. Such remedies could include indemnification \\nor repurchase of an affected mortgage loan. In addition, in \\nconnection with our servicing activities, we could continue to \\nbecome subject to consent orders and settlement agreements \\nwith federal and state regulators for alleged servicing issues and \\npractices.

These committees oversee the \\nadministration and effectiveness of financial risk management \\npolicies and processes used to assess and manage these risks. \\nAt the management level, the Corporate Asset/Liability \\nCommittee (Corporate ALCO), which consists of management \\nfrom finance, risk and business groups, oversees these risks and \\nsupports periodic reports provided to the Board’s Finance \\nCommittee and Risk Committee as appropriate. As discussed in \\nmore detail for market risk activities below, we employ separate \\nmanagement level oversight specific to market risk. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK   Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \\ncan cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the cash flows of the Company’s assets and \\nliabilities generally arising from customer-related lending and \\ndeposit-taking activities. We are subject to interest rate risk \\nbecause: \\n• assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different times \\nor by different amounts; \\n• short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nindependently or with different magnitudes; \\n• the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change; or \\n• interest rates may also have a direct or indirect effect on \\nloan demand, collateral values, credit losses, loan origination \\nvolume, and the fair value of financial instruments and \\nMSRs. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing the earnings \\noutcomes from multiple interest rate scenarios that differ in the \\ndirection of interest rate changes, the degree and speed of \\ninterest rate changes over time, and the projected shape of the \\nyield curve. These scenarios require assumptions regarding \\ndrivers of earnings and balance sheet composition such as loan \\noriginations, prepayment rates on loans and debt securities, \\ndeposit flows and mix, as well as pricing strategies. We \\nperiodically assess and enhance our scenarios and assumptions. \\nOur scenario assumptions reflected the following: \\n• Scenarios are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to our \\nassets and liabilities over time. \\n• Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n• The funding forecast in our base scenario incorporates \\ndeposit mix changes and market funding levels consistent \\nwith the base interest rate trajectory. Our hypothetical \\nscenarios incorporate deposit mix that is the same as in the \\nbase scenario. In higher interest rate scenarios, customer \\ndeposit activity that shifts balances into higher yielding \\nproducts and/or requires additional market funding could \\nreduce the expected benefit from higher rates. \\n• The interest rate sensitivity of deposits as market interest \\nrates change, referred to as deposit betas, are informed by \\nhistorical behavior and expectations for near-term pricing \\nstrategies. Our actual experience may differ from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of deposit \\nrepricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other factors. \\nTable 30 presents the results of the estimated net interest \\nincome sensitivity over the next 12 months from the multiple \\nscenarios compared with our base scenario. The base scenario is a \\nreference point used by the Company for financial planning \\npurposes. These hypothetical scenarios include instantaneous \\nmovements across the yield curve with both lower and higher \\ninterest rates under a parallel shift, as well as steeper and flatter \\nnon-parallel changes in the yield curve. Long-term interest rates \\nare defined as all tenors three years and longer, and short-term \\ninterest rates are defined as all tenors less than three years. \\nTable 30:   Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \\nUsing Instantaneous Movements \\n($ in billions) Dec 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nParallel shift: \\n+100 bps shift in interest rates $ 1.8 2.3 \\n-100 bps shift in interest rates (2.0) (1.7) \\nSteeper yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 1.1 0.8 \\n-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.0) (1.0) \\nFlatter yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates 0.7 1.5 \\n-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (1.1) (0.7) \\nOur interest rate sensitivity indicates that we would expect \\nto benefit from higher interest rates as our assets would reprice \\nfaster and to a greater degree than our liabilities, while in the \\ncase of lower interest rates, our assets would reprice downward \\nand to a greater degree than our liabilities resulting in lower net \\ninterest income. The changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember 31, 2022, to December 31, 2023, reflected updates \\nfor our expected balance sheet composition, including a shift to \\nhigher cost deposits. The magnitude of the benefit, if any, from \\nhigher interest rates may vary from our scenarios, including \\nbecause future deposit pricing and balances may be different \\nfrom our current expectations. The realized impact of interest \\nrate changes may also vary from our base and hypothetical \\nscenarios for various reasons, including any deposit pricing lags. \\nWe use interest rate derivatives and our debt securities \\nportfolio to manage our interest rate exposures. We use \\nderivatives for asset/liability management to (i) convert cash \\nflows from selected assets and/or liabilities from floating-rate \\npayments to fixed-rate payments, or vice versa, (ii) reduce \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) sensitivity of \\nour AFS debt securities portfolio, and/or (iii) economically hedge \\nour mortgage origination pipeline, funded mortgage loans, and \\nMSRs. Derivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of \\nAFS debt securities may negatively affect AOCI, which lowers the \\namount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes unrealized \\ngains or losses related to the transfer of debt securities from AFS \\nto HTM, which are subsequently amortized into earnings over the \\nlife of the security with no further impact from interest rate \\nchanges.

See the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \\nManagement – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market \\nRisk” section in this Report for additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\non commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \\ninformation on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates. \\nThe valuation of our residential MSRs can be highly \\nsubjective and involve complex judgments by management \\nabout matters that are inherently unpredictable. Changes in \\ninterest rates influence a variety of significant assumptions \\ncaptured in the periodic valuation of residential MSRs, including \\nprepayment rates, expected returns and potential risks on the \\nservicing asset portfolio, costs to service, the value of escrow \\nbalances and other servicing valuation elements. See the “Critical \\nAccounting Policies – Valuation of Residential Mortgage \\nServicing Rights” section in this Report for additional \\ninformation on the valuation of our residential MSRs. \\nAn increase in interest rates generally reduces the \\npropensity for refinancing, extends the expected duration of the \\nservicing portfolio, and therefore increases the estimated fair value of the MSRs. However, an increase in interest rates can also \\nreduce mortgage loan demand, including refinancing activity, \\nwhich reduces noninterest income from origination activities. A \\ndecline in interest rates would generally have an opposite impact. \\nTo reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates, our \\nresidential MSRs are economically hedged with a combination of \\nderivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, Eurodollar \\nfutures, highly liquid mortgage forward contracts and interest \\nrate options. Hedging the various sources of interest rate risk in \\nmortgage banking is a complex process that requires \\nsophisticated modeling and constant monitoring. There are \\nseveral potential risks to earnings from mortgage banking \\nrelated to origination volumes and mix, valuation of MSRs and \\nassociated hedging results, the relationship and degree of \\nvolatility between short-term and long-term interest rates, and \\nchanges in servicing and foreclosures costs. While we attempt to \\nbalance our mortgage banking interest rate and market risks, the \\nfinancial instruments we use may not perfectly correlate with the \\nvalues and income being hedged. \\nThe size of the hedge and the particular combination of \\nhedging instruments at any point in time is designed to reduce \\nthe volatility of our earnings over various time frames within a \\nrange of mortgage interest rates. Market factors, the \\ncomposition of the mortgage servicing portfolio, and the \\nrelationship between the origination and servicing sides of our \\nmortgage businesses change continually, and therefore the types \\nof instruments used in our hedging are reviewed daily and \\nrebalanced based on our evaluation of current market factors and \\nthe interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio. \\nFor additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \\nNote 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and \\nNote 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. \\nMARKET RISK   Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \\nrates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \\nbasis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the \\ntrading book, mortgage servicing rights, the hedge effectiveness \\nrisk associated with the mortgage book held at fair value, and \\nimpairment on private equity investments. \\nThe Board’s Finance Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for market risk and oversees the Company’s \\nmarket risk exposure and market risk management strategies. In \\naddition, the Board’s Risk Committee has certain oversight \\nresponsibilities with respect to market risk, including \\ncounterparty risk.

The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \\nsensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \\nmonitoring market risk. These market risk measures are \\nmonitored at both the business unit level and at aggregated \\nlevels on a daily basis. Our corporate market risk management \\nfunction aggregates and monitors exposures against our \\nestablished risk appetite. Changes to the market risk profile are analyzed and reported on a daily basis. The Company monitors \\nvarious market risk exposure measures from a variety of \\nperspectives, including line of business, product, risk type, and \\nlegal entity. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The \\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \\nto establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk \\nlimits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 31 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. Our Trading General VaR uses a historical simulation \\nmodel which assumes that historical changes in market values \\nare representative of the potential future outcomes and \\nmeasures the expected earnings loss of the Company over a \\n1-day time interval at a 99% confidence level. Our historical \\nsimulation model is based on equally weighted data from a \\n12-month historical look-back period. We believe using a \\n12-month look-back period helps ensure the Company’s VaR is \\nresponsive to current market conditions. The 99% confidence \\nlevel equates to an expectation that the Company would incur \\nsingle-day trading losses in excess of the VaR estimate on \\naverage once every 100 trading days. \\nTable 31:   Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category \\nYear ended December 31, \\n2023 2022 \\n(in millions) Period \\nend Average Low High Period \\nend Average Low High \\nCompany Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit $ 30 35 20 52 29 32 19 85 \\nInterest rate 16 33 9 65 25 25 9 88 \\nEquity 23 21 13 31 27 23 13 38 \\nCommodity 3 4 2 8 4 6 2 20 \\nForeign exchange 1 1 0 4 1 1 0 2 \\nDiversification benefit (1) (36) (59) (47) (52) \\nCompany Trading General VaR $ 37 35 39 35 \\n(1) The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly correlated \\ncausing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may occur on \\ndifferent days. \\nSensitivity Analysis   Given the inherent limitations of the VaR \\nmodels, the Company uses other measures, including sensitivity \\nanalysis, to measure and monitor risk. Sensitivity analysis is the \\nmeasure of exposure to a single risk factor, such as a 0.01% \\nincrease in interest rates or a 1% increase in equity prices. We \\nconduct and monitor sensitivity on interest rates, credit spreads, \\nvolatility, equity, commodity, and foreign exchange exposure. \\nSensitivity analysis complements VaR as it provides an indication \\nof risk relative to each factor irrespective of historical market \\nmoves. \\nStress Testing   While VaR captures the risk of loss due to \\nadverse changes in markets using recent historical market data, \\nstress testing is designed to capture the Company’s exposure to \\nextreme but low probability market movements. Stress scenarios \\nestimate the risk of losses based on management’s assumptions \\nof abnormal but severe market movements such as severe credit \\nspread widening or a large decline in equity prices. These \\nscenarios assume that the market moves happen \\ninstantaneously and no repositioning or hedging activity takes \\nplace to mitigate losses as events unfold (a conservative \\napproach since experience demonstrates otherwise). An inventory of scenarios is maintained representing both \\nhistorical and hypothetical stress events that affect a broad \\nrange of market risk factors with varying degrees of correlation \\nand differing time horizons. Hypothetical scenarios assess the \\nimpact of large movements in financial variables on portfolio \\nvalues. Typical examples include a 1% (100 basis point) increase \\nacross the yield curve or a 10% decline in equity market indexes. \\nHistorical scenarios utilize an event-driven approach: the stress \\nscenarios are based on plausible but rare events, and the analysis \\naddresses how these events might affect the risk factors \\nrelevant to a portfolio. \\nThe Company’s stress testing framework is also used in \\ncalculating results in support of the Federal Reserve Board’s \\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) and internal \\nstress tests. Stress scenarios are regularly reviewed and updated \\nto address potential market events or concerns. For more detail \\non the CCAR process, see the “Capital Management” section in \\nthis Report. \\nMARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES   We are directly and indirectly \\naffected by changes in the equity markets.

In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to be able to meet our contractual obligations \\nand other cash commitments efficiently under both normal \\noperating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-specific \\nand/or market stress. For additional information on these \\nobligations, see the following sections and Notes to Financial \\nStatements in this Report: \\n• “Unfunded Credit Commitments” section within Loans and \\nRelated Allowance for Credit Losses (Note 5) \\n• Leasing Activity (Note 8) \\n• Deposits (Note 9) \\n• Long-Term Debt (Note 10) \\n• Guarantees and Other Commitments (Note 17) \\n• Employee Benefits (Note 22) \\n• Income Taxes (Note 23) To help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \\nmonitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \\nCorporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \\nthe Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \\nboth the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \\nthe Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries. \\nLiquidity Stress Tests   Liquidity stress tests are performed to \\nhelp the Company maintain sufficient liquidity to meet \\ncontractual and contingent outflows modeled under a variety of \\nstress scenarios. Our scenarios utilize market-wide as well as   \\nidiosyncratic events, including a range of stress conditions and \\ntime horizons. Stress testing results facilitate evaluation of the \\nCompany’s projected liquidity position during stress and inform \\nfuture needs in the Company’s funding plan. \\nContingency Funding Plan   Our contingency funding plan (CFP), \\nwhich is approved by the Corporate Asset/Liability Committee \\nand the Board’s Risk Committee, sets out the Company’s \\nstrategies and action plans to address potential liquidity needs \\nduring market-wide or idiosyncratic liquidity events. The CFP \\nestablishes measures for monitoring emerging liquidity events \\nand describes the processes for communicating and managing \\nstress events should they occur. The CFP also identifies alternate \\nfunding and liquidity strategies available to the Company in a \\nperiod of stress. \\nLiquidity Standards   We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, \\nOCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity \\nrequirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) \\nestablished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \\n(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells Fargo. \\nWe are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \\nFDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \\nnet stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \\norganization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \\namount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \\ndebt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \\nderivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \\nperiod.

The rules contain two frameworks for calculating capital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced Approach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, and we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both approaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based capital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule to implement the final components of Basel III, which would impact risk-based capital requirements for certain banks. The proposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach and replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the measurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular risk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a new standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The new requirements would be phased in over a three-year period beginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant increase in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its capital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed rule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to address the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet and capital optimization strategies. \\nTable 37 and Table 38 present the risk-based capital \\nrequirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of December\\xa031, 2023.

The countercyclical buffer in effect at December\\xa031, 2023, was 0.00%. \\nThe capital conservation buffer is applicable to certain \\ninstitutions, including Wells Fargo, under the Advanced Approach and is intended to absorb losses during times of economic or financial stress. \\nThe stress capital buffer is calculated based on the decrease \\nin a BHC’s risk-based capital ratios under the severely adverse scenario in the FRB’s annual supervisory stress test and related Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR), plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends. Because the stress capital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ over time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based capital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are subject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for the period October\\xa01, 2023, through September 30, 2024, is 2.90%. \\n52 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Under the rule, we must annually \\ncalculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \\nof the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \\nour size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \\nsubstitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \\nmethodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \\nBoard (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \\ninputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \\nwholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \\nthan under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \\ncalculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \\namount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \\nour annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \\nannual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital surcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our \\nG-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2024.

The resulting weighted values from each of the \\nrisk categories are aggregated for determining total risk-\\nweighted assets (RWAs). \\nThe tables that follow provide information about our risk-\\nbased capital and related ratios as calculated under Basel III \\ncapital rules.

The components used to calculate our minimum \\nTLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of \\nDecember 31, 2023, are presented in Table 46. \\nTable 46:   Components Used to Calculate TLAC and Eligible Unsecured \\nLong-Term Debt Requirements \\nTLAC requirement \\nGreater of: \\n18.00% of RWAs 7.50% of total leverage exposure \\n(the denominator of the SLR \\ncalculation) \\n+ + \\nTLAC buffer (equal to 2.50% of RWAs \\n+ method one G-SIB capital surcharge \\n+ any countercyclical buffer) External TLAC leverage buffer \\n(equal to 2.00% of total leverage \\nexposure) \\nMinimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt \\nGreater of: \\n6.00% of RWAs \\n4.50% of total leverage exposure + \\nGreater of method one and method \\ntwo G-SIB capital surcharge In August 2023, the FRB proposed rules that would, among \\nother things, modify the calculation of eligible long-term debt \\nthat counts towards the TLAC requirements, which would reduce \\nour TLAC ratios. \\nTable 47 provides our TLAC and eligible unsecured long-\\nterm debt and related ratios. \\nTable 47:   TLAC and Eligible Unsecured Long-Term Debt \\nDecember 31, 2023 \\n($ in millions) TLAC (1) Regulatory \\nMinimum \\n(2) Eligible \\nUnsecured \\nLong-term \\nDebt Regulatory \\nMinimum \\nTotal eligible amount $ 308,489 140,760 \\nPercentage of RWAs (3) 25.05% 21.50 11.43 7.50 \\nPercentage of total \\nleverage exposure 13.69 9.50 6.25 4.50 \\n(1) TLAC ratios are calculated using the CECL transition provision issued by federal banking \\nregulators. \\n(2) Represents the minimum required to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and \\ndiscretionary bonus payments. \\n(3) Our minimum TLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements are calculated \\nbased on the greater of RWAs determined under the Standardized and Advanced \\nApproaches. \\nOTHER REGULATORY CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY MATTERS   For \\ninformation regarding the U.S. implementation of the Basel III \\nLCR and NSFR, see the “Risk Management – Asset/ Liability \\nManagement – Liquidity Risk and Funding – Liquidity Standards” \\nsection in this Report. \\nOur principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries, Wells Fargo \\nSecurities, LLC, and Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC, are \\nsubject to regulations to maintain minimum net capital \\nrequirements. As of December 31, 2023, these broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \\nminimum net capital requirements. \\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing \\nOur planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \\nregulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \\nour business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. \\nAs part of the annual CCAR, the FRB generates a supervisory \\nstress test. The FRB reviews the supervisory stress test results as \\nrequired under the Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of \\ncapital actions for all large BHCs and also reviews the Company’s \\nproposed capital actions. \\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\ninstitution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \\nperiods of adverse economic and financial conditions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 57 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

This regulation \\nand oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \\ncompanies conduct business and may continue to result in \\nincreased regulatory compliance costs. The following highlights \\nthe more significant regulations and regulatory oversight \\ninitiatives that have affected or may affect our business. For \\nadditional information about the regulatory matters discussed \\nbelow and other regulations and regulatory oversight matters, \\nsee Part I, Item 1 “Regulation and Supervision” of our 2023 Form \\n10-K, and the “Overview,” “Capital Management,” “Forward-\\nLooking Statements” and “Risk Factors” sections and Note 26 \\n(Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nDodd-Frank Act \\nThe Dodd-Frank Act is the most significant financial reform \\nlegislation since the 1930s. The following provides additional \\ninformation on the Dodd-Frank Act, including certain of its \\nrulemaking initiatives. \\n• Enhanced supervision and regulation of systemically important \\nfirms .   The Dodd-Frank Act grants broad authority to federal \\nbanking regulators to establish enhanced supervisory and \\nregulatory requirements for systemically important firms. \\nThe FRB has finalized a number of regulations implementing \\nenhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding \\ncompanies (BHCs) like Wells Fargo regarding risk-based \\ncapital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, single \\ncounterparty credit limits, and imposing debt-to-equity \\nlimits on any BHC that regulators determine poses a grave \\nthreat to the financial stability of the United States. The FRB \\nand OCC have also finalized rules implementing stress \\ntesting requirements for large BHCs and national banks. \\nFurthermore, to promote a BHC’s safety and soundness and \\nthe financial and operational resilience of its operations, the \\nFRB has finalized guidance regarding effective boards of \\ndirectors of large BHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, \\nhas finalized guidelines establishing heightened governance \\nand risk management standards for large national banks \\nsuch as Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. The OCC guidelines require \\ncovered banks to establish and adhere to a written risk \\ngovernance framework to manage and control their risk-\\ntaking activities. The guidelines also formalize roles and \\nresponsibilities for risk management practices within \\ncovered banks and create certain risk oversight \\nresponsibilities for their boards of directors. In addition to the authorization of enhanced supervisory and regulatory \\nrequirements for systemically important firms, the Dodd-\\nFrank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight \\nCouncil and the Office of Financial Research, which may \\nrecommend new systemic risk management requirements \\nand require new reporting of systemic risks. \\n• Regulation of consumer financial products.   The Dodd-Frank \\nAct established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \\n(CFPB) to ensure that consumers receive clear and accurate \\ndisclosures regarding financial products and are protected \\nfrom unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. The CFPB has \\nissued and proposed a number of rules impacting consumer \\nfinancial products, including rules impacting residential \\nmortgage lending, credit cards, and other financial products \\nand banking related activities, as well as the fees that may be \\ncharged for certain banking products and services. In \\naddition to these rulemaking activities, the CFPB is \\ncontinuing its ongoing supervisory examination activities of \\nthe financial services industry with respect to a number of \\nconsumer businesses and products, including mortgage \\nlending and servicing, fair lending requirements, and auto \\nfinance. \\n• Regulation of swaps and other derivatives activities .   The \\nDodd-Frank Act established a comprehensive framework for \\nregulating over-the-counter derivatives, and, pursuant to \\nauthority granted by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity \\nFutures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and \\nExchange Commission (SEC) have adopted comprehensive \\nsets of rules regulating swaps and security-based swaps, \\nrespectively, and the OCC and other federal regulatory \\nagencies have adopted margin requirements for uncleared \\nswaps and security-based swaps. As a registered swap dealer \\nand a conditionally-registered security-based swap dealer, \\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., is subject to these rules. These rules, \\nas well as others adopted or under consideration by \\nregulators in the United States and other jurisdictions, may \\nnegatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \\nderivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new \\nderivatives or amendments to existing derivatives, and may \\nincrease our costs for engaging in swaps, security-based \\nswaps, and other derivatives activities. \\nRegulatory Capital, Leverage, and Liquidity Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \\nregulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \\nFRB and the OCC.

The \\nCompany and its IDIs are also required to maintain specified \\nleverage and supplementary leverage ratios. In addition, the \\nCompany is required to have a minimum amount of total loss \\nabsorbing capacity for purposes of resolvability and resiliency. \\nFederal banking regulators have also issued final rules requiring a \\nliquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. For \\nadditional information on the final risk-based capital, leverage \\nand liquidity rules, and additional capital requirements applicable \\nto us, see the “Capital Management” and “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding – \\nLiquidity Standards” sections in this Report. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \\nAct require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \\nprepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as \\n“living wills,” designed to facilitate their rapid and orderly \\nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \\nUnder the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \\nreorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \\nperiod of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \\nrisk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the \\nfinancial stability of the United States. In addition to the \\nCompany’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, \\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare \\nand periodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\ndetermine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \\non us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we \\nadequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\nultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \\ndeficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \\noperations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \\nliquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for \\nthe appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \\nimportant financial institution that is in default or in danger of \\ndefault if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \\neffects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \\nappointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation \\nauthority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would \\ndetermine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \\nobligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation \\nauthority requires that security holders of a company in \\nreceivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \\nany losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \\ncreditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \\nstrict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \\nin certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \\nprocedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ \\nclaims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \\nHowever, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the FDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \\nannounced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \\ndesirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \\nliquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \\nexercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is \\npossible. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \\nbanking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \\nmaintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \\nabsorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \\nbanking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding \\nthe failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \\nparent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \\ninstitutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \\nand liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \\norderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to \\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \\n2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended \\nand restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with \\nWFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo \\nSecurities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \\n(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \\nfrom time to time as material entities for resolution planning \\npurposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time \\nas related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related \\nSupport Entities”). Pursuant to the Support Agreement, the \\nParent transferred a significant amount of its assets, including \\nthe majority of its cash, deposits, liquid securities and \\nintercompany loans (but excluding its equity interests in its \\nsubsidiaries and certain other assets), to the IHC and will \\ncontinue to transfer those types of assets to the IHC from time \\nto time. In the event of our material financial distress or failure, \\nthe IHC will be obligated to use the transferred assets to provide \\ncapital and/or liquidity to the Bank, WFS, WFCS, and the Covered \\nEntities pursuant to the Support Agreement. Under the Support \\nAgreement, the IHC will also provide funding and liquidity to the \\nParent through subordinated notes and a committed line of \\ncredit, which, together with the issuance of dividends, is expected \\nto provide the Parent, during business as usual operating \\nconditions, with the same access to cash necessary to service its \\ndebts, pay dividends, repurchase its shares, and perform its other \\nobligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these \\narrangements and transferred any assets. If certain liquidity and/ \\nor capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s \\nboard of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the \\ncommitted line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to \\npay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which \\ncould materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and \\nits ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could \\nresult in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the \\nParent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if \\nthe Support Agreement were not implemented. The respective \\nobligations under the Support Agreement of the Parent, the IHC, \\nthe Bank, and the Related Support Entities are secured pursuant \\nto a related security agreement. \\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \\nrange of options that we may consider during times of \\nidiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any financial \\nweaknesses and restore market confidence without \\nextraordinary government support.

The Company is subject to a number of \\nconsent orders and other regulatory actions, which may \\nrequire the Company, among other things, to undertake \\ncertain changes to its business, operations, products and \\nservices, and risk management practices, and include the \\nfollowing: \\n◦ Consent Orders Discussed in the “Overview ” Section in this \\nReport.   For a discussion of certain consent orders \\napplicable to the Company, see the “Overview” section \\nin this Report. \\n◦ OCC approval of director and senior executive officer \\nappointments and certain post-termination payments.   \\nUnder the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, \\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., remains subject to requirements \\nthat were originally imposed in November 2016 to \\nprovide prior written notice to, and obtain non-\\nobjection from, the OCC with respect to changes in \\ndirectors and senior executive officers, and remains \\nsubject to certain regulatory limitations on post-\\ntermination payments to certain individuals and \\nemployees. • Regulatory Developments in Response to Climate Change.   \\nFederal, state, and non-U.S. governments and government \\nagencies have demonstrated increased attention to the \\nimpacts and potential risks associated with climate change. \\nFor example, federal banking regulators are reviewing the \\nimplications of climate change on the financial stability of \\nthe United States and have issued guidance on the \\nidentification and management by large banks of climate-\\nrelated financial risks. In addition, the SEC has proposed \\nrules that would require public companies to disclose certain \\nclimate-related information, including greenhouse gas \\nemissions, climate-related targets and goals, and \\ngovernance of climate-related risks and relevant risk \\nmanagement processes. Similarly, California’s state \\nlegislature finalized climate-related disclosure laws, while \\nthe European Union finalized its Corporate Sustainability \\nReporting Directive. The approaches taken by various \\ngovernments and government agencies can vary \\nsignificantly, evolve over time, and sometimes conflict. Any \\ncurrent or future rules, regulations, and guidance related to \\nclimate change and its impacts could require us to change \\ncertain of our business practices, reduce our revenue and \\nearnings, impose additional costs on us, subject us to legal or \\nregulatory proceedings, or otherwise adversely affect our \\nbusiness operations and/or competitive position.

Six of these policies are \\ncritical because they require management to make difficult, \\nsubjective and complex judgments about matters that are \\ninherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially \\ndifferent amounts would be reported under different conditions \\nor using different assumptions. These policies govern: \\n• the allowance for credit losses; \\n• the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n• the fair value of financial instruments; \\n• income taxes; \\n• liability for legal actions; and \\n• goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \\nCommittee. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans, which \\nis management’s estimate of the expected credit losses in the \\nloan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments, at the balance \\nsheet date, excluding loans and unfunded credit commitments \\ncarried at fair value or held for sale. Additionally, we maintain an \\nACL for debt securities classified as either HTM or AFS, other \\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost, net investments in \\nleases, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. For \\nadditional information, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) and Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance \\nfor Credit Losses) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFor loans and HTM debt securities, the ACL is measured \\nbased on the remaining contractual term of the financial asset \\n(including off-balance sheet credit exposures) adjusted, as \\nappropriate, for prepayments and permitted extension options \\nusing historical experience, current conditions, and forecasted \\ninformation. For AFS debt securities, the ACL is measured using a \\ndiscounted cash flow approach and is limited to the difference \\nbetween the fair value of the security and its amortized cost. \\nChanges in the ACL and, therefore, in the related provision \\nfor credit losses can materially affect net income. In applying the \\njudgment and review required to determine the ACL, \\nmanagement considerations include the evaluation of past \\nevents, historical experience, changes in economic forecasts and \\nconditions, customer behavior, collateral values, the length of the \\ninitial loss forecast period, and other influences. From time to \\ntime, changes in economic factors or assumptions, business or \\ninvestment strategy, or products or product mix may result in a \\ncorresponding increase or decrease in our ACL. While our \\nmethodology attributes portions of the ACL to specific financial \\nasset classes (loan and debt security portfolios) or loan portfolio \\nsegments (commercial and consumer), the entire ACL is available \\nto absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nJudgment is specifically applied in: \\n• Economic assumptions and the length of the initial loss forecast \\nperiod.   We forecast a wide range of economic variables to \\nestimate expected credit losses. Our key economic variables \\ninclude gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rate, \\nand collateral asset prices. While many of these economic variables are evaluated at the macro-economy level, some \\neconomic variables are forecasted at more granular levels, \\nfor example, using the metro statistical area (MSA) level for \\nunemployment rates, home prices and commercial real \\nestate prices. At least annually, we assess the length of the \\ninitial loss forecast period and have currently set the peri od \\nto two years. For the initial loss forecast period, we forecast \\nmultiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \\nscenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \\npessimistic (downside) scenarios. Management exercises \\njudgment when assigning weight to the economic scenarios \\nthat are used to estimate future credit losses. \\n• Reversion to historical loss expectations. Our long-term \\naverage loss expectations are estimated by reverting to the \\nlong-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \\nforecasted economic variables. These long-term averages \\nare based on observations over multiple economic cycles. \\nThe reversion period, which may be up to two years, is \\nassessed on a quarterly basis . \\n• Credit risk ratings applied to individual commercial loans, \\nunfunded credit commitments, and debt securities.   Individually \\nassessed credit risk ratings are considered key credit \\nvariables in our modeled approaches to help assess \\nprobability of default and loss given default. Borrower \\nquality ratings are aligned to the borrower’s financial \\nstrength and contribute to forecasted probability of default \\ncurves. Collateral quality ratings combined with forecasted \\ncollateral prices (as applicable) contribute to the forecasted \\nseverity of loss in the event of default. These credit risk \\nratings are reviewed by experienced senior credit officers \\nand subjected to reviews by an internal team of credit risk \\nspecialists. \\n• Usage of credit loss estimation models.   We use internally \\ndeveloped models that incorporate credit attributes and \\neconomic variables to generate credit loss estimates. \\nManagement uses judgment and quantitative analytics in \\nthe determination of segmentation, modeling approach, and \\nvariables that are leveraged in the models. These models are \\nindependently validated in accordance with the Company’s \\npolicies.

We also assess our models for limitations \\nagainst the company-wide risk inventory to help \\nappropriately capture known and emerging risks in our \\nestimate of expected credit losses and apply overlays as \\nneeded. \\n• Valuation of collateral .   The current fair value of collateral is \\nutilized to assess the expected credit losses when a financial \\nasset is considered to be collateral dependent. We apply \\njudgment when valuing the collateral either through \\nappraisals, evaluation of the cash flows of the property, or \\nother quantitative techniques. Decreases in collateral \\nvaluations support incremental ACL or charge-downs and \\nincreases in collateral valuation are included in the ACL as a \\nnegative allowance when the financial asset has been \\npreviously written-down below current recovery value. \\n• Contractual term considerations.   The remaining contractual \\nterm of a loan is adjusted for expected prepayments and \\ncertain expected extensions, renewals, or modifications. We \\nextend the contractual term when we are not able to \\nunconditionally cancel contractual renewals or extension \\noptions.

These amounts represent management’s \\njudgment of risks inherent in the processes and assumptions \\nused in establishing the ACL. We also consider economic \\nenvironmental factors, modeling assumptions and \\nperformance, process risk, and other subjective factors, \\nincluding industry trends and emerging risk assessments. \\nSensitivity   The ACL for loans is sensitive to changes in key \\nassumptions which requires significant management judgment. \\nFuture amounts of the ACL for loans will be based on a variety of \\nfactors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit quality, \\nand general forecasted economic conditions. The forecasted \\neconomic variables used could have varying impacts on different \\nfinancial assets or portfolios. Additionally, throughout numerous \\ncredit cycles, there are observed changes in economic variables \\nsuch as the unemployment rate, GDP and real estate prices which \\nmay not move in a correlated manner as variables may move in \\nopposite directions or differ across portfolios or geography. \\nOur sensitivity analysis does not represent management’s \\nview of expected credit losses at the balance sheet date. We \\napplied a 100% weight to a more severe downside scenario in our \\nsensitivity analysis to reflect the potential for further economic \\ndeterioration. The outcome of the scenario was influenced by the \\nduration, severity, and timing of changes in economic variables \\nwithin the scenario. The sensitivity analysis resulted in a \\nhypothetical increase in the ACL for loans of approximately \\n$6.2 billion at December 31, 2023. The hypothetical increase in \\nour ACL for loans does not incorporate the impact of \\nmanagement judgment for qualitative factors applied in the \\ncurrent ACL for loans, which may have a positive or negative \\neffect on the results. It is possible that others performing similar \\nsensitivity analyses could reach different conclusions or results. \\nThe sensitivity analysis excludes the ACL for debt securities \\nand other financial assets given its size relative to the overall \\nACL. Management believes that the estimate for the ACL for \\nloans was appropriate at the balance sheet date. \\nValuation of Residential Mortgage Servicing Rights \\n(MSRs) \\nMSRs are assets that represent the rights to service mortgage \\nloans for others. We generally recognize MSRs when we retain \\nservicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of \\nloans we originate. We carry our MSRs related to residential \\nmortgage loans at fair value. Periodic changes in our residential \\nMSRs and the economic hedges used to hedge our residential \\nMSRs are reflected in earnings. \\nWe use models to estimate the fair value of our residential \\nMSRs. The models are independently validated in accordance \\nwith Company policies. Collectively, the models are used to \\ncalculate the present value of estimated future net servicing \\nincome and incorporate inputs and assumptions that market \\nparticipants use in estimating fair value. Certain significant inputs \\nand assumptions generally are not observable in the market and \\nrequire judgment to determine. If observable market indications \\ndo become available, these are factored into the estimates as \\nappropriate. Significant inputs and assumptions requiring \\nmanagement judgement include: \\n• The mortgage loan prepayment rate used to estimate future \\nnet servicing income.   The prepayment rate is the annual rate \\nat which borrowers are forecasted to repay their mortgage \\nloan principal; this rate also includes estimated borrower defaults. We use models to estimate prepayment rate and \\nborrower defaults which are influenced by changes in \\nmortgage interest rates and borrower behavior. \\n• The discount rate used to present value estimated future net \\nservicing income. The discount rate is the required rate of \\nreturn investors in the market would expect for an asset \\nwith similar risk and is estimated using a dynamic \\nmethodology for market curves and volatility. To determine \\nthe discount rate, we consider the risk premium for \\nuncertainties in the cash flow estimates such as from \\nservicing operations (e.g., possible changes in future \\nservicing costs and earnings on escrow accounts). \\n• The expected cost to service loans used to estimate future net \\nservicing income.   The cost to service loans includes \\nestimates for unreimbursed expenses, such as delinquency \\nand foreclosure costs, which considers the number of \\ndefaulted loans as well as the incremental cost to service \\nloans in default and foreclosure. We use a market \\nparticipant’s view for our estimated cost to service and our \\nactual costs may vary from that estimate. \\nBoth prepayment rate and discount rate assumptions can, \\nand generally will, change quarterly as market conditions and \\nmortgage interest rates change. For example, an increase in \\neither the prepayment rate or discount rate assumption results \\nin a decrease in the fair value of the MSRs, while a decrease in \\neither assumption would result in an increase in the fair value of \\nthe MSRs. In recent years, there have been significant market-\\ndriven fluctuations in loan prepayment rate and the discount \\nrate. These fluctuations can be rapid and may be significant in the \\nfuture. Additionally, future regulatory or investor changes in \\nservicing standards as well as changes in individual state \\nforeclosure legislation or changes in market participant \\ninformation regarding servicing cost assumptions, may have an \\nimpact on our servicing cost assumption and our MSR valuation \\nin future periods. We periodically benchmark our MSR fair value \\nestimate to independent appraisals. \\nFor a description of our valuation and sensitivity of MSRs, \\nsee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \\nand Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \\nEntities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nFair Value of Financial Instruments \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell a \\nfinancial asset or paid to transfer a financial liability in an orderly \\ntransaction between market participants at the measurement \\ndate. \\nWe use fair value measurements to comply with both \\nrecognition and disclosure requirements. For example, assets and \\nliabilities held for trading purposes, marketable equity securities, \\nAFS debt securities, and derivatives are recorded at fair value on \\nour consolidated balance sheet each period. Other financial \\ninstruments, such as loans held for investment and substantially \\nall nonmarketable equity securities are not recorded at fair value \\neach period but may require nonrecurring fair value adjustments \\nthrough the application of an accounting method such as lower \\nof cost or fair value (LOCOM), write-downs of individual assets, \\nor application of the measurement alternative for certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities. We also disclose our estimate \\nof fair value for financial instruments not recorded at fair value, \\nsuch as HTM debt securities, loans held for investment, and long-\\nterm debt. \\nDisclosure of fair value measurements for assets and \\nliabilities are made using a three-level hierarchy.

Observable inputs \\nreflect market-derived or market-based information obtained \\nfrom independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our \\nestimates about market data. \\nWhen developing fair value measurements, we maximize the \\nuse of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable \\ninputs. When available, we use quoted prices in active markets to \\nmeasure fair value. If quoted prices in active markets are not \\navailable, fair value measurement is based upon models that \\ngenerally use market-based or independently sourced market \\nparameters, including interest rate yield curves, prepayment \\nrates, option volatilities and currency rates. However, when \\nobservable market data is limited or not available, fair value \\nestimates are typically determined using internal models based \\non unobservable inputs. These models are independently \\nvalidated in accordance with the Company’s policies. Additionally, \\nwe obtain pricing information from third-party vendors to record \\nfair values and to corroborate internal prices. Third-party \\nvalidation procedures are performed over the reasonableness of \\nprices received. \\nWhen using internal models based on unobservable inputs, \\nmanagement judgment is necessary as we make judgments \\nabout significant assumptions that market participants would \\nuse to estimate fair value. Determination of these assumptions \\nincludes consideration of many factors, including market \\nconditions and liquidity levels. Changes in the market conditions, \\nsuch as reduced liquidity in the capital markets or changes in \\nsecondary market activities, may reduce the availability and \\nreliability of quoted prices or observable data used to determine \\nfair value. In such cases, adjustments to available quoted prices or \\nobservable market data may be required. For example, we may \\nadjust a price received from a third-party pricing service using \\ninternal models based on discounted cash flows when the impact \\nof illiquid markets has not already been incorporated in the fair \\nvalue measurement. \\nWe continually assess the level and volume of market \\nactivity in our debt and equity security classes in determining \\nadjustments, if any, to quoted prices. Given market conditions \\ncan change over time, our determination of which securities \\nmarkets are considered active or inactive can change. If we \\ndetermine a market to be inactive, the degree to which quoted \\nprices require adjustment may also change. \\nSignificant judgment is also applied in the determination of \\nwhether certain assets measured at fair value are classified as \\nLevel 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. When making this \\njudgment, we consider available information, including \\nobservable market data, indications of market liquidity and \\norderliness, and our understanding of the valuation techniques \\nand significant inputs used to estimate fair value. The \\nclassification as Level 2 or Level 3 is based upon the specific facts \\nand circumstances of each instrument or instrument category \\nand judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nunobservable inputs to each instrument’s fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety.

Current income tax \\nexpense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \\nfor the current period and includes income tax expense related to \\nuncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \\nmore likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \\nmanagement believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \\nrealization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \\nrealization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes \\nin deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \\nbalance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is \\nbased on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \\ntax basis of assets and liabilities and recognizes enacted changes \\nin income tax rates and laws in the period in which they \\noccur. Deferred tax assets, including those related to net \\noperating losses and tax credit carryforwards, are recognized \\nsubject to management’s judgment that realization is more likely \\nthan not. When necessary, valuation allowances are established \\nto reduce deferred tax assets to the realizable amounts. \\nThe income tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate \\nare complex and subject to different interpretations by \\nmanagement and the relevant government taxing authorities. In \\nestablishing a provision for income tax expense, we must make \\njudgments about the application of these inherently complex tax \\nlaws. We must also make estimates about when in the future \\ncertain items will affect taxable income in the various tax \\njurisdictions. Our interpretations may be subjected to review \\nduring examination by taxing authorities and disputes may arise \\nover the respective tax positions. We attempt to resolve these \\ndisputes during the tax examination and audit process and \\nultimately through the court systems when applicable. \\nWe monitor relevant tax authorities and may update our \\nestimate of accrued income taxes due to changes in income tax \\nlaws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory \\nauthorities on a quarterly basis. Updates to our estimate of \\naccrued income taxes also may result from our own income tax \\nplanning and from the resolution of income tax controversies. \\nSuch updates to our estimates may be material to our operating \\nresults for any given quarter. \\nWells Fargo & Company 63 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We establish accruals for legal \\nactions when potential losses associated with the actions \\nbecome probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For \\nsuch accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best \\nestimate within a range of potential losses that are both \\nprobable and estimable; however, if we cannot determine a best \\nestimate, then we record the low end of the range of those \\npotential losses. The actual costs of resolving legal actions may \\nbe substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for \\nthose actions. \\nWe apply judgment when establishing an accrual for \\npotential losses associated with legal actions and in establishing \\nthe range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the accrual. \\nOur judgment in establishing accruals and the range of \\nreasonably possible losses in excess of the Company’s accrual for \\nprobable and estimable losses is influenced by our understanding \\nof information currently available related to the legal evaluation \\nand potential outcome of actions, including input and advice on \\nthese matters from our internal counsel, external counsel and \\nsenior management.

The eventual outcome may be a scenario that was \\nnot considered or was considered remote in anticipated \\noccurrence. Accordingly, our estimate of potential losses will \\nchange over time and the actual losses may vary significantly. \\nThe outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and subject \\nto significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \\ndetermine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \\ninherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \\nmay be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \\npossible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \\nmay be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \\nreasonably possible loss. \\nSee Note 13 (Legal Actions) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for additional information. \\nGoodwill Impairment \\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or \\nmore frequently as macroeconomic and other business factors \\nwarrant. These factors may include trends in short-term or long-\\nterm interest rates, negative trends from reduced revenue \\ngenerating activities or increased costs, adverse actions by \\nregulators, or company specific factors such as a decline in \\nmarket capitalization. \\nWe identify reporting units to be assessed for goodwill \\nimpairment at the reportable operating segment level or one \\nlevel below. We calculate reporting unit carrying amounts as \\nallocated capital plus assigned goodwill and other intangible \\nassets. We allocate capital to the reporting units under a risk-\\nsensitive framework driven by our regulatory capital \\nrequirements. We estimate fair value of the reporting units based on a balanced weighting of fair values estimated using \\nboth an income approach and a market approach which are \\nintended to reflect Company performance and expectations as \\nwell as external market conditions. The methodologies for \\ncalculating carrying amounts and estimating fair values are \\nperiodically assessed by senior management and updated as \\nnecessary. \\nThe income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) \\nanalysis, which estimates the present value of future cash flows \\nassociated with each reporting unit. A DCF analysis requires \\nsignificant judgment to model financial forecasts for our \\nreporting units, which includes future expectations of economic \\nconditions and balance sheet changes, as well as considerations \\nrelated to future business activities. The forecasts are reviewed \\nby senior management. For periods after our financial forecasts, \\nwe incorporate a terminal value estimate. We discount these \\nforecasted cash flows using a consistent rate derived from the \\ncapital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \\nequity for our reporting units, reflecting risks and uncertainties in \\nthe financial markets and in our internally generated business \\nprojections. \\nThe market approach utilizes observable market data from \\ncomparable publicly traded companies, such as price-to-earnings \\nor price-to-tangible book value ratios, to estimate a reporting \\nunit’s fair value. The results of the market approach include a \\ncontrol premium to represent our expectation of a hypothetical \\nacquisition of the reporting unit. Management uses judgment in \\nthe selection of comparable companies and includes those with \\nthe most similar business activities. \\nThe aggregate fair value of our reporting units exceeded our \\nmarket capitalization for our fourth quarter 2023 assessment. \\nFactors that we believe contributed to this difference included an \\noverall premium that would be paid to gain control of the \\noperating and financial decisions of the Company, as well as \\nshort-term market volatility and other factors that may not be \\nreflected consistently between the Company’s market \\ncapitalization and the fair value of individual reporting units. \\nBased on our fourth quarter 2023 assessment, there was no \\nimpairment of goodwill at December 31, 2023. The fair values of \\neach reporting unit exceeded their carrying amounts by \\nsubstantial amounts, with the exception of our Consumer \\nLending reporting unit. Although the fair value of our Consumer \\nLending reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by more \\nthan 10%, it was the most sensitive to changes in valuation \\nassumptions. We plan to continue the execution of our more \\nfocused strategy for the home lending business in the near-term. \\nThe credit card business has forecasted higher loan balances \\ndriven by growth from new products and services. Significant \\nchanges to these plans or forecasts or a significant increase in the \\ndiscount rate could result in an impairment for the Consumer \\nLending reporting unit. The amount of goodwill assigned to the \\nConsumer Lending reporting unit was $7.1 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2023. \\nDeclines in our ability to generate revenue, significant \\nincreases in credit losses or other expenses, or adverse actions \\nfrom regulators are factors that could result in material goodwill \\nimpairment of any reporting unit in a future period. \\nFor additional information on goodwill and our reportable \\noperating segm ents, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies ), Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets ), and Note 20 (Operating Segments ) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report.

We discuss below \\nrisk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and \\ncondition, and the value of, and return on, an investment in the \\nCompany. \\nECONOMIC, FINANCIAL MARKETS, INTEREST RATES, AND \\nLIQUIDITY RISKS \\nOur financial results have been, and will continue to be, \\nmaterially affected by general economic conditions, and a \\ndeterioration in economic conditions or in the financial \\nmarkets may materially adversely affect our lending and other \\nbusinesses and our financial results and condition. We \\ngenerate revenue from the interest and fees we charge on the \\nloans and other products and services we sell, and a substantial \\namount of our revenue and earnings comes from the net interest \\nincome and fee income that we earn from our consumer and \\ncommercial lending and banking businesses. These businesses \\nhave been, and will continue to be, materially affected by the \\nstate of the U.S. economy, particularly unemployment levels and \\nhome prices. The negative effects and continued uncertainty \\nstemming from U.S. fiscal, monetary and political matters, \\nincluding concerns about deficit and debt levels, inflation, taxes, \\nand U.S. debt ratings, have impacted and may continue to impact \\nthe global economy. Moreover, geopolitical matters, including \\ninternational political unrest or disturbances, wars, and terrorist \\nactivities, as well as continued concerns over commodity prices, \\nrestrictions on international trade and corresponding retaliatory \\nmeasures, and global economic difficulties, may impact the \\nstability of financial markets and the global economy. Any \\nimpacts to the global economy could have a similar impact to the \\nU.S. economy. A prolonged period of slow growth in the global \\neconomy or any deterioration in general economic conditions \\nand/or the financial markets resulting from the above matters or \\nany other events or factors that may disrupt or weaken the U.S. \\nor global economy , could materially adversely affect our \\nfinancial results and condition. \\nA weakening in business or economic conditions, including \\nhigher unemployment levels or declines in home prices, as well as \\nhigher interest rates, can also adversely affect our customers’ \\nability to repay their loans or other obligations, which can \\nincrease our credit losses. If unemployment levels worsen or if \\nhome prices fall we would expect to incur elevated charge-offs \\nand provision expense from increases in our allowance for credit \\nlosses. These conditions may adversely affect not only consumer \\nloan performance but also commercial and CRE loans, especially \\nfor those business borrowers that rely on the health of industries \\nthat may experience deteriorating economic conditions. The \\nability of these and other borrowers to repay their loans may \\ndeteriorate, causing us, as one of the largest commercial and CRE \\nlenders in the U.S., to incur significantly higher credit losses. In \\naddition, weak or deteriorating economic conditions make it \\nmore challenging for us to increase our consumer and \\ncommercial loan portfolios by making loans to creditworthy \\nborrowers at attractive yields. Furthermore, weak economic \\nconditions, as well as competition and/or increases in interest \\nrates, could soften demand for our loans resulting in our \\nretaining a much higher amount of lower yielding liquid assets on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. If economic conditions worsen and unemployment rises, which also would likely result in a \\ndecrease in consumer and business confidence and spending, the \\ndemand for our products, including our consumer and \\ncommercial loans, may fall, reducing our interest and noninterest \\nincome and our earnings. \\nA deterioration in business and economic conditions, which \\nmay erode consumer and investor confidence levels, and/or \\nincreased volatility of financial markets, also could adversely \\naffect financial results for our fee-based businesses, including our \\ninvestment advisory, securities brokerage, wealth management, \\nmarkets and investment banking businesses. For example, \\nbecause investment advisory fees are often based on the value of \\nassets under management, a fall in the market prices of those \\nassets could reduce our fee income. Changes in stock market \\nprices could affect the trading activity of investors, reducing \\ncommissions and other fees we earn from our brokerage \\nbusiness. In addition, adverse market conditions may negatively \\naffect the performance of products we have provided to \\ncustomers, which may expose us to legal actions or additional \\ncosts. Poor economic conditions and volatile or unstable financial \\nmarkets also can negatively affect our debt and equity \\nunderwriting and advisory businesses, as well as our venture \\ncapital business and trading activities, including through \\nincreased counterparty credit risk. Any deterioration in global \\nfinancial markets and economies, including as a result of any \\ngeopolitical matters or unrest, may adversely affect the revenue \\nand earnings of our international operations, particularly our \\nglobal financial institution and correspondent banking services. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” and “– Credit Risk Management” \\nsections in this Report. \\nChanges in interest rates and financial market values could \\nreduce our net interest income and earnings, as well as our \\nother comprehensive income, including as a result of \\nrecognizing losses on the debt and equity securities that we \\nhold in our portfolio or trade for our customers. Changes in \\neither our net interest margin or the amount or mix of earning \\nassets we hold, including as a result of the asset cap under the \\nFebruary 2018 consent order with the FRB, could affect our net \\ninterest income and our earnings. Changes in interest rates can \\naffect our net interest margin. Although the yield we earn on our \\nassets and the funding costs of our liabilities tend to move in the \\nsame direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can \\nrise or fall faster than the other, causing our net interest margin \\nto expand or contract. If our funding costs rise faster than the \\nyield we earn on our assets or if the yield we earn on our assets \\nfalls faster than our funding costs, our net interest margin tends \\nto contract. \\nThe amount and type of earning assets we hold can affect \\nour yield and net interest income. We hold earning assets in the \\nform of loans and debt and equity securities, among other assets. \\nAs noted above, if the economy worsens we may see lower \\ndemand for loans by creditworthy customers, reducing our yield \\nand net interest income. In addition, our net interest income and \\nnet interest margin can be negatively affected by a prolonged \\nperiod of low interest rates as it may result in us holding lower \\nyielding loans and securities on our consolidated balance sheet, \\nparticularly if we are unable to replace the maturing higher \\nyielding assets with similar higher yielding assets. A prolonged \\nperiod of high interest rates, however, may continue to \\nnegatively affect loan demand and could result in higher credit \\n68 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Similarly, a prolonged period of high interest \\nrates may increase our funding costs, including the rates we pay \\non customer deposits. As described below, changes in interest \\nrates also affect our mortgage business, including the value of \\nour MSRs. In an effort to address high inflation, the FRB \\nsignificantly raised its target range for the federal funds rate over \\nthe last two years, however, the FRB could decide to further raise \\nit or lower it in 2024. \\nChanges in the slope of the yield curve – or the spread \\nbetween short-term and long-term interest rates – could also \\nreduce our net interest income and net interest margin. \\nNormally, the yield curve is upward sloping, meaning short-term \\nrates are lower than long-term rates. When the yield curve \\nflattens or inverts, our net interest income and net interest \\nmargin could decrease if the cost of our short-term funding \\nincreases relative to the yield we can earn on our long-term \\nassets. Moreover, a negative interest rate environment, in which \\ninterest rates drop below zero, could reduce our net interest \\nincome and net interest margin due to a likely decline in the \\ninterest we could earn on loans and other earning assets, while \\nalso likely requiring us to pay to maintain our deposits with \\nthe FRB. \\nWe assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect on \\nour earnings under various scenarios that differ based on \\nassumptions about the direction, magnitude and speed of \\ninterest rate changes and the slope of the yield curve. We may \\nhedge some of that interest rate risk with interest rate \\nderivatives. We also experience the somewhat offsetting effect \\nthat our mortgage loan originations and servicing rights can \\nprovide as their revenue impact tends to move in opposite \\ndirections based on changes in interest rates. \\nWe generally do not hedge all of our interest rate risk. There \\nis always the risk that changes in interest rates, credit spreads or \\noption volatility could reduce our net interest income and \\nearnings, as well as our other comprehensive income, in material \\namounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially \\ndifferent than what we assumed. For example, if interest rates \\nrise or fall faster than we assumed or the slope of the yield curve \\nchanges, we may experience significant losses, including \\nunrealized losses, on debt securities in our portfolio. To reduce \\nour interest rate risk, we may rebalance our portfolios of debt \\nsecurities and loans, refinance our debt and take other strategic \\nactions. We may incur losses when we take such actions. In \\naddition, changes in interest rates can result in increased basis \\nrisk, which could limit the effectiveness of our hedging activities. \\nWe have a significant number of assets and liabilities, such as \\ncommercial loans, adjustable-rate mortgage loans, derivatives, \\ndebt securities, and long-term debt, referenced to benchmark \\nrates, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), or \\nother financial metrics. If any such benchmark rate or other \\nreferenced financial metric is significantly changed, replaced or \\ndiscontinued, or ceases to be recognized as an acceptable market \\nbenchmark rate or financial metric, there may be uncertainty or \\ndifferences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or \\npayment amount depending on the terms of the governing \\ninstrument. This could impact the financial performance of \\npreviously recorded transactions, result in losses on financial \\ninstruments we hold, require different hedging strategies or \\nresult in ineffective or increased basis risk on existing hedges, \\nimpact the overall interest rate environment and the availability \\nor cost of funding transactions, affect our capital and liquidity \\nplanning and management, or have other adverse financial \\nconsequences. It may also result in significant operational, \\nsystems, or other practical challenges, increased compliance and operational costs, legal or regulatory proceedings, reputational \\nharm, or other adverse consequences. Because of changing \\neconomic and market conditions, as well as credit ratings, \\naffecting issuers and the performance of any underlying \\ncollateral, we may be required to recognize impairment in future \\nperiods on the securities we hold. Furthermore, the value of the \\ndebt securities we hold can fluctuate due to changes in interest \\nrates, issuer creditworthiness, and other factors. Our net income \\nalso is exposed to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, \\nforeign exchange rates, and equity and commodity prices in \\nconnection with our trading activities, which are conducted \\nprimarily to accommodate the investment and risk management \\nactivities of our customers, as well as when we execute economic \\nhedging to manage certain balance sheet risks. Trading debt \\nsecurities and equity securities held for trading are carried at fair \\nvalue with realized and unrealized gains and losses recorded in \\nnoninterest income. As part of our business to support our \\ncustomers, we trade public debt and equity securities and other \\nfinancial instruments that are subject to market fluctuations with \\ngains and losses recognized in net income. In addition, although \\nhigh market volatility can increase our exposure to trading-\\nrelated losses, periods of low volatility may have an adverse \\neffect on our businesses as a result of reduced customer activity \\nlevels. Although we have processes in place to measure and \\nmonitor the risks associated with our trading activities, including \\nstress testing and hedging strategies, there can be no assurance \\nthat our processes and strategies will be effective in avoiding \\nlosses that could have a material adverse effect on our financial \\nresults. \\nThe value of our marketable and nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities can fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Marketable \\nequity securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and \\nlosses reflected in earnings. Nonmarketable equity securities are \\ncarried under the cost method, equity method, or measurement \\nalternative, while others are carried at fair value with unrealized \\ngains and losses reflected in earnings. Earnings from our equity \\nsecurities portfolio may be volatile and hard to predict, and may \\nhave a significant effect on our earnings from period to period. \\nWhen, and if, we recognize gains may depend on a number of \\nfactors, including general economic and market conditions, the \\nprospects of the companies in which we invest, when a company \\ngoes public, the size of our position relative to the public float, \\nand whether we are subject to any resale restrictions. \\nNonmarketable equity securities include our venture capital \\nand private equity investments that could result in significant \\nimpairment losses for those investments carried under the \\nmeasurement alternative or equity method. If we recognize an \\nimpairment for an investment, we write-down the carrying value \\nof the investment to fair value, resulting in a charge to earnings, \\nwhich could be significant. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Interest Rate Risk,” “– Mortgage \\nBanking Interest Rate and Market Risk,” “– Market Risk – Trading \\nActivities,” and “– Market Risk – Equity Securities” and the \\n“Balance Sheet Analysis – Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities” sections in this Report and Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities), Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities) and Note 4 (Equity Securities) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation \\nof our business, and our financial results and condition could be \\nmaterially adversely affected if we do not effectively manage \\nour liquidity.

The financial system also \\nexperienced disruption and volatility in early 2023 due to the \\nfailure of several banks, and episodes of disruption, volatility or \\nother adverse market conditions may continue to occur if there \\nare additional instances of actual or threatened bank failures. \\nMarket disruption and volatility could also impact our credit \\nspreads, which are the amount in excess of the interest rate of \\nU.S. Treasury securities, or other benchmark securities, of the \\nsame maturity that we need to pay to our funding providers. \\nIncreases in interest rates and our credit spreads could \\nsignificantly increase our funding costs. Other conditions and \\nfactors that could materially adversely affect our liquidity and \\nfunding include a lack of market or customer confidence in the \\nCompany or negative news about the Company or the financial \\nservices industry generally which also may result in a loss of \\ndeposits and/or negatively affect our ability to access the capital \\nmarkets; any inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; \\ndisruptions or volatility in the market for securities repurchase \\nagreements, or any inability to effectively access the market for \\nsecurities repurchase agreements, which also may increase our \\nshort-term funding costs; regulatory requirements or \\nrestrictions, including changes to regulatory capital or liquidity \\nrequirements; unexpectedly high or accelerated customer draws \\non lines of credit; any inability to access secured borrowing \\nfacilities through the FHLB or FRB, or any negative perception in \\nthe market created by accessing these facilities; and, as described \\nbelow, reductions in one or more of our credit ratings. Many of \\nthe above conditions and factors may be caused by events over \\nwhich we have little or no control. Similarly, the speed with which \\ninformation is disseminated and the speed with which customers \\ncan withdraw funds in response to information may also \\ncontribute to a faster and greater loss of deposits, particularly \\nuninsured or non-operational deposits, as well as other adverse \\neffects on liquidity or funding, similar to what contributed to the \\nfailure of several banks in early 2023. There can be no assurance \\nthat significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets \\nwill not occur in the future. For example, concerns over \\ngeopolitical issues, commodity and currency prices, as well as \\nglobal economic conditions, may cause financial market volatility. \\nIn addition, concerns regarding U.S. government debt levels, \\nincluding any potential failure to raise the debt limit, and any \\nassociated downgrade of U.S. government debt ratings may \\ncause uncertainty and volatility as well. A downgrade of the \\nsovereign debt ratings of the U.S. government or the debt \\nratings of related institutions, agencies or instrumentalities, as \\nwell as other fiscal or political events could, in addition to causing \\neconomic and financial market disruptions, materially adversely \\naffect the market value of the U.S. government securities or \\nfederal agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) that we hold, \\nthe availability of those securities as collateral for borrowing, and \\nour ability to access capital markets on favorable terms, as well as have other material adverse effects on the operation of our \\nbusiness and our financial results and condition. \\nAs noted above, we rely heavily on customer deposits for our \\nfunding and liquidity. We compete with banks and other financial \\nservices companies for deposits. If our competitors raise the \\nrates they pay on deposits our funding costs may increase, either \\nbecause we raise our rates to avoid losing deposits or because we \\nlose deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of \\nfunding. Checking and savings account balances and other forms \\nof customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive \\nother investment opportunities, such as stocks, bonds, or money \\nmarket mutual funds, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. \\nWhen customers move money out of bank deposits and into \\nother investments, we may lose a relatively low-cost source of \\nfunds, increasing our funding costs and negatively affecting our \\nliquidity. In addition, we may continue to reduce certain deposit \\nbalances in order to manage under the asset cap. \\nIf we are unable to continue to fund our assets through \\ncustomer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms, \\nif there are changes to our regulatory capital or liquidity \\nrequirements, or if we suffer an increase in our borrowing costs \\nor otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively (including on \\nan intra-day or intra-affiliate basis), our liquidity, net interest \\nmargin, and financial results and condition may be materially \\nadversely affected. As we did during the financial crisis in 2009, \\nwe may also need, or be required by our regulators, to raise \\nadditional capital through the issuance of common stock, which \\ncould dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or \\neven eliminate our common stock dividend to preserve capital or \\nto raise additional capital. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management” section in this Report. \\nAdverse changes in our credit ratings could have a material \\nadverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows, and financial results \\nand condition. Our borrowing costs and ability to obtain funding \\nare influenced by our credit ratings. Reductions in one or more of \\nour credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow \\nfunds and raise the costs of our borrowings substantially and \\ncould cause creditors and business counterparties to raise \\ncollateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely \\naffect our ability to raise funding. Credit ratings and credit \\nratings agencies’ outlooks are based on the ratings agencies’ \\nanalysis of many quantitative and qualitative factors, including \\nour capital adequacy, liquidity, asset quality, business mix, the \\nlevel and quality of our earnings, and rating agency assumptions \\nregarding the probability and extent of federal financial \\nassistance or support.

These regulations \\ngenerally protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, \\nconsumers, investors, employees, or the banking and financial \\nsystem as a whole, not necessarily our security holders. \\nEconomic, market and political conditions during the past few \\nyears have led to a significant amount of legislation and \\nregulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services \\nindustry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of \\nfinancial services companies from banking regulators. These laws \\nand regulations may continue to affect the manner in which we \\ndo business and the products and services that we provide, affect \\nor restrict our ability to compete in our current businesses or our \\nability to enter into or acquire new businesses, reduce or limit our \\nrevenue, affect our compliance and risk management activities, limit subsidiary capital distributions, increase our capital or \\nliquidity requirements, impose additional fines or assessments \\non us, intensify the regulatory supervision of us and the financial \\nservices industry, and adversely affect our business operations or \\nhave other negative consequences. Our businesses and revenue \\nin non-U.S. jurisdictions are also subject to risks from political, \\neconomic and social developments in those jurisdictions, \\nincluding sanctions or business restrictions, asset freezes or \\nconfiscation, unfavorable political or diplomatic developments, or \\nfinancial or social instability. In addition, changes to tax laws, \\nregulations, and guidance may negatively impact our effective \\nincome tax rate, financial results, or the amount of any tax assets \\nor liabilities. Furthermore, greater government oversight and \\nscrutiny of Wells Fargo, as well as financial services companies \\ngenerally, has increased our operational and compliance costs as \\nwe must continue to devote substantial resources to enhancing \\nour procedures and controls and meeting heightened regulatory \\nstandards and expectations. Any failure to meet regulatory \\nrequirements, standards or expectations, either in the U.S. or in \\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions, could continue to result in significant fines, \\npenalties, restrictions on certain business activities, reputational \\nharm, or other adverse consequences. \\nOur consumer businesses, including our mortgage, auto, \\ncredit card and other consumer lending and non-lending \\nbusinesses, are subject to numerous and, in many cases, highly \\ncomplex consumer protection laws and regulations, as well as \\nenhanced regulatory scrutiny and more and expanded regulatory \\nexaminations and/or investigations. In particular, the CFPB’s \\nrules and requirements may continue to increase our compliance \\ncosts, limit the fees we can charge for certain products and \\nservices, and require changes in our business practices, which \\ncould limit or negatively affect our earnings as well as the \\nproducts and services that we offer our customers. If we fail to \\nmeet enhanced regulatory requirements and expectations with \\nrespect to our consumer businesses, we may be subject to \\nincreased costs, fines, penalties, restrictions on our business \\nactivities including the products and services we can provide, \\nreputational harm, or other adverse consequences. \\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established a \\ncomprehensive framework for regulating over-the-counter \\nderivatives, and the CFTC, SEC, and other federal regulatory \\nagencies have adopted rules regulating swaps, security-based \\nswaps, and derivatives activities. These rules may continue to \\nnegatively impact customer demand for over-the-counter \\nderivatives, impact our ability to offer customers new derivatives \\nor amendments to existing derivatives, and increase our costs for \\nengaging in swaps, security-based swaps, and other derivatives \\nactivities. \\nWe are also subject to various rules and regulations related \\nto the prevention of financial crimes and combating terrorism, \\nincluding the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These rules and \\nregulations require us to, among other things, implement policies \\nand procedures related to anti-money laundering, anti-bribery \\nand corruption, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, \\ncurrency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. \\nAlthough we have policies and procedures designed to comply \\nwith these rules and regulations, to the extent they are not fully \\neffective or do not meet regulatory standards or expectations, \\nwe may be subject to fines, penalties, restrictions on certain \\nbusiness activities, reputational harm, or other adverse \\nconsequences. \\nOur businesses are also subject to laws and regulations \\nenacted by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators and governmental \\nauthorities relating to the privacy of the information of \\ncustomers, employees and others.

This consent order limits \\nthe Company’s total consolidated assets as defined under the \\nconsent order to the level as of December 31, 2017, until certain \\nconditions are met. This limitation could continue to adversely \\naffect our results of operations or financial condition. We are also \\nsubject to April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC \\nregarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance policies and certain mortgage interest rate \\nlock extensions. In addition, we are subject to a September 2021 \\nconsent order with the OCC regarding loss mitigation activities in \\nthe Company’s Home Lending business. Similarly, we are subject \\nto a December 2022 consent order with the CFPB regarding \\nmultiple matters related to automobile lending, consumer \\ndeposit accounts, and mortgage lending. We are also subject to \\nolder consent orders including dating back to 2011. Addressing \\nthese and other regulatory actions is expected to take multiple \\nyears, and we are likely to continue to experience issues or delays \\nalong the way in satisfying their requirements. We are also likely \\nto continue to identify more issues as we implement our risk and \\ncontrol infrastructure, which may result in additional regulatory \\nactions. \\nUnder the April 2018 consent order with the OCC, the Bank \\nremains subject to requirements that were originally imposed in \\nNovember 2016 to provide prior written notice to, and obtain \\nnon-objection from, the OCC with respect to changes in directors \\nand senior executive officers, and remains subject to certain \\nregulatory limitations on post-termination payments to certain \\nindividuals and employees. \\nThe Company may be subject to further actions, including \\nthe imposition of additional consent orders, regulatory \\nagreements or civil money penalties, by federal regulators \\nregarding similar or other issues. Regulators have indicated the \\npotential for escalating consequences for banks that do not \\ntimely resolve open issues or have repeat issues. Furthermore, \\nissues or delays in satisfying the requirements of a regulatory \\naction could affect our progress on others. Failure to satisfy the \\nrequirements of a regulatory action on a timely basis could result \\nin additional fines, penalties, business restrictions, limitations on \\nsubsidiary capital distributions, increased capital or liquidity \\nrequirements, enforcement actions, and other adverse \\nconsequences, which could be significant. For example, in \\nSeptember 2021, the OCC assessed a $250 million civil money \\npenalty against the Company related to insufficient progress in \\naddressing requirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent \\norder and loss mitigation activities in the Company’s Home \\nLending business. Compliance with the February 2018 FRB \\nconsent order, the April 2018 CFPB and OCC consent orders, the \\nSeptember 2021 OCC consent order, the December 2022 CFPB \\nconsent order, older consent orders including dating back to \\n2011, and any other consent orders or regulatory actions, as well \\nas the implementation of their requirements, may continue to \\nincrease the Company’s costs, require the Company to reallocate \\nresources away from growing its existing businesses, subject the \\nCompany to business restrictions, negatively impact the \\nCompany’s capital and liquidity, require the Company to undergo significant changes to its business, operations, products and \\nservices, and risk management practices, and subject the \\nCompany to other adverse consequences. For additional \\ninformation on the Company’s consent orders, see the \\n“Overview” section in this Report. \\nAny future legislation, rule and/or regulation also could \\nsignificantly change our regulatory environment, increase our \\ncost of doing business, limit the activities we may pursue, affect \\nthe competitive balance among banks and other financial \\nservices companies, and have a material adverse effect on our \\nfinancial results and condition. \\nFor additional information on the significant regulations and \\nregulatory oversight initiatives that have affected or may affect \\nour business, see the “Regulatory Matters” section in this Report \\nand the “Regulation and Supervision” section in our 2023 Form \\n10-K. \\nWe could be subject to more stringent capital, leverage or \\nliquidity requirements or restrictions on our growth, activities \\nor operations if regulators determine that our resolution or \\nrecovery plan is deficient.   Pursuant to rules adopted by the FRB \\nand the FDIC, Wells Fargo prepares and periodically submits \\nresolution plans, also known as “living wills,” designed to facilitate \\nour rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial \\ndistress or failure. There can be no assurance that the FRB or \\nFDIC will respond favorably to the Company’s resolution plans. \\nIf the FRB and/or FDIC determine that a resolution plan has \\ndeficiencies, they may impose more stringent capital, leverage or \\nliquidity requirements on us or restrict our growth, activities or \\noperations until we adequately remedy the deficiencies. If the \\nFRB and/or FDIC ultimately determine that we have been unable \\nto remedy any deficiencies, they could require us to divest certain \\nassets or operations. \\nIn addition to our resolution plans, we must also prepare and \\nperiodically submit to the FRB a recovery plan that identifies a \\nrange of options that we may consider during times of \\nidiosyncratic or systemic economic stress to remedy any \\nfinancial weaknesses and restore market confidence without \\nextraordinary government support. The Bank must also prepare \\nand periodically submit to the OCC a recovery plan. If either the \\nFRB or the OCC determines that our recovery plan is deficient, \\nthey may impose fines, restrictions on our business or ultimately \\nrequire us to divest assets. \\nOur security holders may suffer losses in a resolution of \\nWells Fargo even if creditors of our subsidiaries are paid in full.   \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \\nliquidation authority,” which allows for the appointment of the \\nFDIC as receiver. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation authority requires \\nthat security holders of a company in receivership bear all losses \\nbefore U.S. taxpayers are exposed to any losses. There are \\nsubstantial differences in the rights of creditors between the \\norderly liquidation authority and the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, \\nincluding the right of the FDIC to disregard the strict priority of \\ncreditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in certain \\ncircumstances and the use of an administrative claims procedure \\ninstead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ claims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \\nHowever, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo.

In \\nparticular, the Company is subject to rules issued by federal \\nbanking regulators to implement Basel III risk-based capital \\nrequirements for U.S. banking organizations. These capital rules, \\namong other things, establish required minimum ratios relating \\ncapital to different categories of assets and exposures. Federal \\nbanking regulators have also imposed a leverage ratio and a \\nsupplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs like Wells Fargo and \\nour insured depository institutions. The FRB has also finalized \\nrules to address the amount of equity and unsecured long-term \\ndebt a U.S. G-SIB must hold to improve its resolvability and \\nresiliency, often referred to as total loss absorbing capacity \\n(TLAC). Similarly, federal banking regulators have issued final \\nrules that implement a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable \\nfunding ratio. In addition, as part of its obligation to impose enhanced \\ncapital and risk-management standards on large financial firms \\npursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB has issued a capital \\nplan rule that establishes capital planning and other \\nrequirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB has also finalized a number of regulations \\nimplementing enhanced prudential requirements for large BHCs \\nlike Wells Fargo regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk \\nand liquidity management, single counterparty credit limits, and \\nimposing debt-to-equity limits on any BHC that regulators \\ndetermine poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the \\nUnited States. The FRB and OCC have also finalized rules \\nimplementing stress testing requirements for large BHCs and \\nnational banks. Furthermore, the FRB has established \\nexpectations regarding effective boards of directors of large \\nBHCs. The OCC, under separate authority, has also established \\nheightened governance and risk management standards for large \\nnational banks, such as the Bank. \\nThe Basel standards and federal regulatory capital, leverage, \\nliquidity, TLAC, capital planning, and other requirements may \\nlimit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including \\ncommon stock dividends and stock repurchases, and may require \\nus to increase our capital and/or liquidity. Any requirement that \\nwe increase our regulatory capital, regulatory capital ratios or \\nliquidity, including due to changes in regulatory requirements, \\nsuch as from the adoption of the current proposal to revise the \\nBasel standards in the U.S., changes in regulatory interpretations \\nregarding risk-weighted asset calculation methodologies, \\nincluding the impact from securitizations of credit risk, or as a \\nresult of business growth, acquisitions or a change in our risk \\nprofile, could increase our funding costs, reduce our flexibility to \\nsource and deploy funding, or require us to liquidate assets or \\notherwise change our business, product offerings and/or \\ninvestment plans, which may negatively affect our financial \\nresults. Although not currently anticipated, new capital \\nrequirements and/or our regulators may require us to raise \\nadditional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock \\nmay dilute the ownership of existing stockholders. In addition, \\nfederal banking regulations may continue to increase our \\ncompliance costs as well as limit our ability to invest in our \\nbusiness or provide loans or other products and services to our \\ncustomers. \\nFor additional information, see the “Capital Management,” \\n“Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Liquidity Risk \\nand Funding – Liquidity Standards,” and “Regulatory Matters” \\nsections in this Report and the “Regulation and Supervision” \\nsection in our 2023 Form 10-K. \\nFRB policies, including policies on interest rates, can \\nsignificantly affect business and economic conditions and our \\nfinancial results and condition.

We also incur credit risk in connection with trading \\nand other activities. As noted above, if the economic \\nenvironment were to deteriorate, more of our customers and \\ncounterparties may have difficulty in repaying their loans or \\nother obligations which could result in a higher level of credit \\nlosses and provision for credit losses. We reserve for credit losses \\nby establishing an allowance through a charge to earnings. The \\namount of this allowance is based on our assessment of expected \\ncredit losses over the anticipated life of our loan portfolio \\n(including unfunded credit commitments). The process for \\ndetermining the amount of the allowance is critical to our \\nfinancial results and condition. It requires difficult, subjective, and \\ncomplex judgments about the future, including forecasts of \\neconomic or market conditions that might impair the ability of \\nour borrowers to repay their loans. We might increase the \\nallowance because of changing economic conditions, including \\nfalling home or commercial real estate values, higher \\nunemployment or inflation, significant loan growth, changes in \\nconsumer behavior, or other market conditions that adversely \\naffect borrowers, or other factors. Additionally, the regulatory \\nenvironment or external factors, such as natural disasters, \\ndisease pandemics such as COVID-19, political or social matters, \\nor trade policies, also can continue to influence recognition of \\ncredit losses in our loan portfolios and impact our allowance for \\ncredit losses. \\nFuture allowance levels may increase or decrease based on a \\nvariety of factors, including loan balance changes, portfolio credit \\nquality and mix changes, and changes in general economic \\nconditions. While we believe that our allowance for credit losses \\nwas appropriate at December 31, 2023, there is no assurance \\nthat it will be sufficient to cover future credit losses. In the event \\nof significant deterioration in economic conditions or if we \\nexperience significant loan growth, we may be required to \\nincrease the allowance in future periods, which would reduce our \\nearnings. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nCredit Risk Management” and “Critical Accounting Policies – \\nAllowance for Credit Losses” sections in this Report. \\nWe may have more credit risk and higher credit losses to the \\nextent our loans are concentrated by loan type, industry \\nsegment, borrower type, or location of the borrower or \\ncollateral. \\xa0 Our credit risk and credit losses can increase if our \\nloans are concentrated to borrowers engaged in the same or \\nsimilar activities or to borrowers who individually or as a group \\nmay be uniquely or disproportionately affected by economic or \\nmarket conditions. Similarly, challenging economic or market \\nconditions, or trade policies, affecting a particular industry or \\ngeography may also impact related or dependent industries or the ability of borrowers living in such affected areas or working in \\nsuch industries to meet their financial obligations. We \\nexperienced the effect of concentration risk in 2009 and 2010 \\nwhen we incurred greater than expected losses in our residential \\nreal estate loan portfolio due to a housing slowdown and greater \\nthan expected deterioration in residential real estate values in \\nmany markets, including the Central Valley California market and \\nseveral Southern California metropolitan statistical areas. As \\nCalifornia is our largest banking state in terms of loans, \\ndeterioration in real estate values and underlying economic \\nconditions in those markets or elsewhere in California could \\nresult in materially higher credit losses. In addition, changes in \\nconsumer behavior or other market conditions may adversely \\naffect borrowers in certain industries or sectors, which may \\nincrease our credit risk and reduce the demand by these \\nborrowers for our products and services. Moreover, deterioration \\nin macro-economic conditions generally across the country could \\nresult in materially higher credit losses, including for our \\nresidential real estate loan portfolio, which includes \\nnonconforming mortgage loans we retain on our balance sheet. \\nWe may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates as \\nour consumer real estate secured lines of credit reach their \\ncontractual end of draw period and begin to amortize. \\nWe are currently one of the largest CRE lenders in the U.S. \\nA deterioration in economic conditions that negatively affects \\nthe business performance of our CRE borrowers, including \\nincreases in interest rates and related refinancing risks at \\nmaturity, declines in commercial property values, and/or changes \\nin consumer behavior or other market conditions, such as a \\ncontinued decrease in the demand for office space, could result in \\nmaterially higher credit losses and have a material adverse effect \\non our financial results and condition. \\nChallenges and/or changes in non-U.S. economic conditions \\nmay increase our non-U.S. credit risk. Economic difficulties in \\nnon-U.S. jurisdictions could also indirectly have a material \\nadverse effect on our credit performance and results of \\noperations and financial condition to the extent they negatively \\naffect the U.S. economy and/or our borrowers who have non-U.S. \\noperations. \\nDue to regulatory requirements, we must clear certain \\nderivative transactions through central counterparty \\nclearinghouses (CCPs), which results in credit exposure to these \\nCCPs. Similarly, because we are a member of various CCPs, we \\nmay be required to pay a portion of any losses incurred by the \\nCCP in the event that one or more members of the CCP defaults \\non its obligations.

As our customer base and locations have a \\nbroad geographic footprint throughout the U.S. and \\ninternationally, as we have increasingly used the internet and \\nmobile banking to provide products and services to our \\ncustomers, as customer, public, legislative and regulatory \\nexpectations regarding operational and information security \\nhave increased, and as cyber and other information security \\nattacks have become more prevalent and complex, our \\noperational systems, controls and infrastructure must continue \\nto be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, \\ndisruptions and breakdowns. Our business, financial, accounting, \\ndata processing systems or other operating systems and \\nfacilities may stop operating properly, become insufficient based \\non our evolving business needs, or become disabled or damaged \\nas a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly \\nor partially beyond our control. For example, there have been and \\ncould in the future be sudden increases in customer transaction \\nvolume; electrical or telecommunications outages; degradation \\nor loss of internet, website or mobile banking availability; natural \\ndisasters such as earthquakes, tornados, and hurricanes; disease \\npandemics such as COVID-19; events arising from local or larger \\nscale political or social matters, including terrorist acts; and, as \\ndescribed below, cyber attacks or other information security \\nincidents. The COVID-19 pandemic or any new pandemic could \\nresult in the occurrence of new, unanticipated adverse effects on \\nus or the recurrence of adverse effects similar to those already \\nexperienced, including creating additional operational and \\ncompliance risks, such as the need to comply with rapidly \\nchanging regulatory requirements and to quickly implement new \\nmeasures to protect the functionality of our systems, networks, \\nand operations. \\nFurthermore, enhancements and upgrades to our \\ninfrastructure or operating systems may be time-consuming, \\nentail significant costs, and create risks associated with \\nimplementing new systems and integrating them with existing \\nones. Due to the complexity and interconnectedness of our \\nsystems, the process of enhancing our infrastructure and \\noperating systems, including their security measures and \\ncontrols, can itself create a risk of system disruptions and \\nsecurity issues. Similarly, we may not be able to timely recover \\ncritical business processes or operations that have been \\ndisrupted, which may further increase any associated costs and \\nconsequences of such disruptions. Although we have enterprise \\nincident response processes, business continuity plans and other \\nsafeguards in place to help provide operational resiliency, our \\nbusiness operations may be adversely affected by significant and \\nwidespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating \\nsystems that support our businesses and customers. For \\nexample, we have experienced system issues caused by a variety \\nof factors that have resulted in intermittent service \\ninterruptions, such as temporary disruptions to online and mobile \\nbanking services, delays in posting transactions, and customer \\ndifficulty signing into accounts. \\nAs a result of financial institutions and technology systems \\nbecoming more interconnected and complex, any operational \\nincident at a third party may increase the risk of loss or material \\nimpact to us or the financial industry as a whole. Furthermore, \\nthird parties on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \\nbusiness activities or to which we outsource operations, such as \\nexchanges, clearing houses, financial intermediaries or vendors \\nthat provide services or security solutions for our operations, \\ncould continue to be sources of operational risk to us, including \\nfrom information breaches or loss, breakdowns, disruptions or \\nfailures of their own systems or infrastructure, or any deficiencies \\nin the performance of their responsibilities. These risks are increased to the extent we rely on a single third party or on third \\nparties in a single geographic area. We are also exposed to the \\nrisk that a disruption or other operational incident at a common \\nservice provider to our third parties could impede their ability to \\nprovide services or perform their responsibilities for us. In \\naddition, we must meet regulatory requirements and \\nexpectations regarding our use of third-party service providers, \\nand any failure by our third-party service providers to meet their \\nobligations to us or to comply with applicable laws, rules, \\nregulations, or Wells Fargo policies could result in fines, penalties, \\nrestrictions on our business, or other adverse consequences. \\nDisruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure, controls \\nor operating systems that support our businesses and \\ncustomers, failures of the third parties on which we rely to \\nadequately or appropriately provide their services or perform \\ntheir responsibilities, or our failure to effectively manage or \\noversee our third-party relationships, could result in business \\ndisruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, remediation and other costs, violations of \\napplicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, customer \\nharm, or other adverse consequences, any of which could \\nmaterially adversely affect our results of operations or financial \\ncondition. \\nA cyber attack or other information security incident could \\nhave a material adverse effect on our results of operations, \\nfinancial condition, or reputation. \\xa0 Information security risks for \\nlarge financial institutions such as Wells Fargo have generally \\nincreased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of \\nnew technologies, the use of the internet, mobile devices, and \\ncloud technologies to conduct financial transactions, the \\nincreased prevalence and availability of artificial intelligence, the \\nincrease in remote work arrangements, and the increased \\nsophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, \\nterrorists, activists, and other external parties, including foreign \\nstate-sponsored parties. Those parties also may continue to \\nattempt to misrepresent personal or financial information to \\ncommit fraud, obtain loans or other financial products from us, or \\nattempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, or other \\nusers of our systems to disclose confidential, proprietary, or \\nother information to gain access to our data or that of our \\ncustomers. Geopolitical matters may also elevate the risk of an \\ninformation security threat, particularly by foreign state-\\nsponsored parties or their supporters. As noted above, our \\noperations rely on the secure processing, transmission and \\nstorage of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our \\ncomputer systems and networks. Our banking, brokerage, \\ninvestment advisory, and capital markets businesses rely on our \\ndigital technologies, computer and email systems, software, \\nhardware, and networks to conduct their operations. In addition, \\nto access our products and services, our customers may use \\npersonal smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices that are \\nbeyond our control systems. Our technologies, systems, \\nsoftware, networks, and our customers’ devices continue to be \\nthe target of cyber attacks or other information security threats, \\nwhich could materially adversely affect us, including as a result of \\nfraudulent activity, the unauthorized release, gathering, \\nmonitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of Wells Fargo’s or our \\ncustomers’ confidential, proprietary and other information, or \\nthe disruption of Wells Fargo’s or our customers’ or other third \\nparties’ business operations.

We are also exposed \\nto the risk that an employee or other person acting on behalf of \\nthe Company fails to comply with applicable policies and \\nprocedures and inappropriately circumvents information security \\ncontrols for personal gain or other improper purposes. \\nDue to the increasing interconnectedness and complexity of \\nfinancial institutions and technology systems, an information \\nsecurity incident at a third party or a third party’s downstream \\nservice providers may increase the risk of loss or material impact \\nto us or the financial industry as a whole. In addition, third parties \\n(including their downstream service providers) on which we rely, \\nincluding those that facilitate our business activities or to which \\nwe outsource operations, such as internet, mobile technology, \\nhardware, software, and cloud service providers, continue to be \\nsources of information security risk to us. We could suffer \\nmaterial harm, including business disruptions, losses or \\nremediation costs, reputational damage, legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, or other adverse consequences as a result of the \\nfailure of those third parties to adequately or appropriately \\nsafeguard their technologies, systems, networks, hardware, and \\nsoftware, or as a result of our or our customers’ data being \\ncompromised due to information security incidents affecting \\nthose third parties. \\nOur risk and exposure to information security threats \\nremains heightened because of, among other things, the \\npersistent and evolving nature of these threats, the prominent \\nsize and scale of Wells Fargo and its role in the financial services \\nindustry, our plans to continue to implement our digital and \\nmobile banking channel strategies and develop additional remote \\nconnectivity solutions to serve our customers when and how \\nthey want to be served, our geographic footprint and \\ninternational presence, our use of third parties, the outsourcing \\nof some of our business operations, and the current global \\neconomic and political environment. For example, Wells Fargo \\nand other financial institutions, as well as our third-party service \\nproviders, continue to be the target of various evolving and \\nadaptive information security threats, including cyber attacks, \\nmalware, ransomware, other malicious software intended to \\nexploit hardware or software vulnerabilities, phishing, credential \\nvalidation, and distributed denial-of-service, in an effort to \\ndisrupt the operations of financial institutions, test their \\ncybersecurity capabilities, commit fraud, or obtain confidential, \\nproprietary or other information. Cyber attacks have also \\nfocused on targeting online applications and services, such as \\nonline banking, as well as cloud-based and other products and \\nservices provided by third parties, and have targeted the \\ninfrastructure of the internet, causing the widespread \\nunavailability of websites and degrading website performance. As \\na result, information security and the continued development \\nand enhancement of our controls, processes and systems \\ndesigned to protect our networks, computers, software and data \\nfrom attack, damage or unauthorized access remain a priority for \\nWells Fargo. We are also involved in industry cybersecurity \\nefforts and working with other parties, including our third-party \\nservice providers and governmental agencies, to continue to \\nenhance defenses and improve resiliency to information security \\nthreats. As these threats continue to evolve, we expect to \\ncontinue to be required to expend significant resources to \\ndevelop and enhance our protective measures or to investigate \\nand remediate any information security vulnerabilities or \\nincidents. Because the investigation of any information security \\nbreach is inherently unpredictable and would require time to \\ncomplete, we may not be able to immediately address the \\nconsequences of a breach, which may further increase any \\nassociated costs and consequences. Moreover, to the extent our insurance covers aspects of information security risk, such \\ninsurance may not be sufficient to cover all liabilities or losses \\nassociated with an information security breach. \\nCyber attacks or other information security incidents \\naffecting us or third parties (including their downstream service \\nproviders) on which we rely, including those that facilitate our \\nbusiness activities or to which we outsource operations, or \\naffecting the networks, systems or devices that our customers \\nuse to access our products and services, could result in business \\ndisruptions, loss of revenue or customers, legal or regulatory \\nproceedings, compliance, remediation and other costs, violations \\nof applicable privacy and other laws, reputational damage, or \\nother adverse consequences, any of which could materially \\nadversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. \\nOur framework for managing risks may not be fully effective in \\nmitigating risk and loss to us. \\xa0 Our risk management framework \\nseeks to mitigate risk and loss to us. We have established \\nprocesses and procedures intended to identify, measure, \\nmonitor, report and analyze the types of risk to which we are \\nsubject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest \\nrate risk, operational risk, legal and compliance risk, and \\nreputational risk, among others. However, as with any risk \\nmanagement framework, there are inherent limitations to our \\nrisk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the \\nfuture, risks that we have not appropriately anticipated, \\nidentified or managed. Our risk management framework is also \\ndependent on ensuring that effective operational controls and an \\nappropriate risk mindset exist throughout the Company. The \\ninability to develop effective operational controls or to foster the \\nappropriate culture throughout the Company, including the \\ninability to align performance management and compensation to \\nachieve the desired culture, could adversely impact the \\neffectiveness of our risk management framework. Similarly, if we \\nare unable to effectively manage our business or operations, we \\nmay be exposed to increased risks or unexpected losses. We \\nprocess a large number of transactions each day and could \\ncontinue to experience increased costs, regulatory investigations, \\nor other adverse consequences if we do not accurately or \\ncompletely execute a process or transaction, whether due to \\nhuman error or otherwise; if we are unable to detect and prevent \\nfraudulent activity; or if an employee or third-party service \\nprovider fails to comply with applicable policies and procedures, \\ninappropriately circumvents controls, or engages in other \\nmisconduct. \\nIn certain instances, we rely on models to measure, monitor \\nand predict risks, such as market, interest rate, liquidity and \\ncredit risks, as well as to help inform business decisions; however, \\nthere is no assurance that these models will appropriately or \\nsufficiently capture all relevant risks or accurately predict future \\nevents or exposures. Furthermore, certain of our models are \\nsubject to regulatory review and approval, and any failure to \\nmeet regulatory standards or expectations could result in fines, \\npenalties, restrictions on certain business activities, or other \\nadverse consequences, and any required modifications or \\nchanges to these models can impact our capital ratios and \\nrequirements and result in increased operational and compliance \\ncosts. In addition, we rely on data to aggregate and assess our \\nvarious risk exposures and business activities, and any issues with \\nthe quality or effectiveness of our data, including our \\naggregation, management, and validation procedures, could \\nresult in ineffective risk management practices, business \\ndecisions or customer service, inefficient use of resources, or \\ninaccurate regulatory or other risk reporting.

We \\nmaintain systems and procedures designed to ensure that we \\ncomply with applicable laws and regulations. However, we are \\nsubject to heightened compliance and regulatory oversight and \\nexpectations, particularly due to the evolving and increasingly \\ncomplex regulatory landscape we operate in. We are also subject \\nto consent orders and other regulatory actions that subject us to \\nvarious conditions and restrictions. In addition, a single event or \\nissue may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations \\nand proceedings, either by multiple federal and state agencies in \\nthe U.S. or by multiple regulators and other governmental \\nentities in different jurisdictions. Also, the laws and regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate may be different or even \\nconflict with each other, such as differences between U.S. federal \\nand state law or differences between U.S. and non-U.S. laws as to \\nthe products and services we may offer or other business \\nactivities we may engage in, which can lead to compliance \\ndifficulties or issues. Additionally, regulatory or compliance issues \\nat other financial institutions could result in regulatory scrutiny \\nfor us. We could also be subject to regulatory actions, including \\nfines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \\nconsequences, if we fail to obtain applicable licensing or \\nregistration in any jurisdiction in which we offer our products and \\nservices. Furthermore, many legal and regulatory regimes require \\nus to report transactions and other information to regulators and \\nother governmental authorities, self-regulatory organizations, \\nexchanges, clearing houses and customers. We may be subject to \\nfines, penalties, business restrictions, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we do not timely, completely, or accurately \\nprovide regulatory reports, customer notices, or disclosures. \\nMoreover, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for \\nthe imposition of fines, penalties, business restrictions, or other \\nadverse consequences for noncompliance even though the \\nnoncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even \\nthough there were systems and procedures in place at the time \\ndesigned to ensure compliance. For example, we are subject to \\nregulations issued by the Office of Foreign Assets Control \\n(OFAC) that prohibit financial institutions from participating in \\nthe transfer of property belonging to the governments of certain \\nnon-U.S. countries and designated nationals of those countries. \\nOFAC may impose fines, penalties, or restrictions on certain \\nbusiness activities for inadvertent or unintentional violations \\neven if reasonable processes are in place to prevent the \\nviolations. Any violation of these or other applicable laws or \\nregulatory requirements, even if inadvertent or unintentional, or \\nany failure to meet regulatory standards or expectations, \\nincluding any failure to satisfy the conditions of any consent \\norders or other regulatory actions, could result in significant \\nfines, penalties, restrictions on certain business activities, \\nnegative impacts to our capital and liquidity, requirements to \\nundergo significant changes to our business, operations, \\nproducts and services, and risk management practices, \\nreputational harm, loss of customers, or other adverse \\nconsequences.

Accomplishing these business \\nplans or strategies may be complex, time intensive, require \\nsignificant financial, technological, management and other \\nresources, may divert management attention and resources away \\nfrom other areas of the Company, and may impact our expenses \\nand ability to generate revenue.

To the extent we are \\nunable to develop or execute effective business plans or \\nstrategies or manage change effectively, our competitive \\nposition, reputation, prospects for growth, and results of \\noperations may be adversely affected. In addition, from time to time, we may decide to divest \\ncertain businesses or assets. Difficulties in executing a divestiture \\nmay cause us not to realize any expected cost savings or other \\nbenefits from the divestiture, or may result in higher than \\nexpected losses of employees or harm our ability to retain \\ncustomers. The divestiture or winding down of certain businesses \\nor assets may also result in the impairment of goodwill or other \\nlong-lived assets related to those businesses or assets, which \\ncould adversely affect our financial results. \\nSimilarly, we may explore opportunities to expand our \\nproducts, services, and assets through strategic acquisitions of \\ncompanies or businesses in the financial services industry. We \\ngenerally must receive federal regulatory approvals before we \\ncan acquire a bank, bank holding company, or certain other \\nfinancial services businesses. We cannot be certain when or if, or \\non what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals \\nwill be granted. We might be required to sell banks, branches \\nand/or business units or assets or issue additional equity as a \\ncondition to receiving regulatory approval for an acquisition. \\nWhen we do announce an acquisition, our stock price may fall \\ndepending on the size of the acquisition, the type of business to \\nbe acquired, the purchase price, and the potential dilution to \\nexisting stockholders or our earnings per share if we issue \\ncommon stock in connection with the acquisition. Furthermore, \\ndifficulty in integrating an acquired company or business may \\ncause us not to realize expected revenue increases, cost savings, \\nincreases in geographic or product presence, and other projected \\nbenefits from the acquisition. The integration could result in \\nhigher than expected deposit attrition, loss of key employees, an \\nincrease in our compliance costs or risk profile, disruption of our \\nbusiness or the acquired business, or otherwise harm our ability \\nto retain customers and employees or achieve the anticipated \\nbenefits of the acquisition. Time and resources spent on \\nintegration may also impair our ability to grow our existing \\nbusinesses. Many of the foregoing risks may be increased if the \\nacquired company or business operates internationally or in a \\ngeographic location where we do not already have significant \\nbusiness operations and/or employees. \\nOur operations and business could be adversely affected by the \\nimpacts of climate change.   The physical effects of climate \\nchange, including the increased prevalence and severity of \\nextreme weather events and natural disasters, such as \\nhurricanes, droughts, and wildfires, could damage or interfere \\nwith our operations or those of our third-party service providers, \\nwhich could disrupt our business, increase our costs, or cause \\nlosses.

For additional information on regulatory \\ndevelopments in response to climate change, see the \\n“Regulatory Matters” section in this Report. \\nWe are exposed to potential financial loss or other adverse \\nconsequences from legal actions. \\xa0 Wells Fargo and some of its \\nsubsidiaries are involved in judicial, regulatory, governmental, \\narbitration, and other proceedings or investigations concerning \\nmatters arising from the conduct of our business activities, and \\nmany of those proceedings and investigations expose \\nWells Fargo to potential financial loss or other adverse \\nconsequences. There can be no assurance as to the ultimate \\noutcome of any of these legal actions. We establish accruals for \\nlegal actions when potential losses associated with the actions \\nbecome probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We \\nmay still incur costs for a legal action even if we have not \\nestablished an accrual. In addition, the actual cost of resolving a \\nlegal action may be substantially higher than any amounts \\naccrued for that action. The ultimate resolution of a pending legal \\naction, depending on the remedy sought and granted, could \\nmaterially adversely affect our results of operations and financial \\ncondition. \\nAs noted above, we are subject to heightened regulatory \\noversight and scrutiny, which may lead to regulatory \\ninvestigations, proceedings or enforcement actions. In addition \\nto imposing potentially significant fines, penalties, business \\nrestrictions, and other adverse consequences, regulatory \\nauthorities may require criminal pleas or other admissions of \\nwrongdoing and compliance with other conditions in connection \\nwith settling such matters, which can lead to reputational harm, \\nloss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access capital \\nmarkets, limitations on capital distributions, the inability to \\nengage in certain business activities or offer certain products or \\nservices, and/or other direct and indirect adverse effects. \\nFor additional information, see Note 13 (Legal Actions) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nMORTGAGE BUSINESS RISKS \\nOur mortgage banking revenue can be volatile from quarter to \\nquarter, including from the impact of changes in interest rates, \\nand we rely on the GSEs to purchase our conforming loans to \\nreduce our credit risk and provide liquidity to fund new \\nmortgage loans. \\xa0 We earn revenue from fees we receive for \\noriginating mortgage loans and for servicing mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates can affect these fees, as well as the fair \\nvalue of our MSRs. When rates rise, the demand for mortgage \\nloans usually tends to fall, reducing the revenue we receive from \\nloan originations. Under the same conditions, revenue from our \\nMSRs usually tends to increase due to a decline in the likelihood of prepayments, which increases the fair value of our MSRs. \\nWhen rates fall, mortgage originations usually tend to increase \\nand the value of our MSRs usually tends to decline, also with \\nsome offsetting revenue effect. Even though changes in interest \\nrates can cause this offsetting effect, the effect is not perfect, \\neither in amount or timing. \\nWe typically use derivatives and other instruments to hedge \\nour mortgage banking interest rate risk. We may not hedge all of \\nour risk, and we may not be successful in hedging any of the risk. \\nHedging is not a perfect science, and we could incur significant \\nlosses from our hedging activities. \\nWe rely on the GSEs to purchase mortgage loans that meet \\ntheir conforming loan requirements and on government insuring \\nagencies, such as the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and \\nthe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), to insure or guarantee \\nloans that meet their policy requirements. If the GSEs or \\ngovernment insuring agencies were to limit or reduce their \\npurchasing, insuring or guaranteeing of loans, our ability to fund, \\nand thus originate, new mortgage loans, could be reduced. We \\ncannot assure that the GSEs or government insuring agencies will \\nnot materially limit their purchases, insuring or guaranteeing of \\nconforming loans or change their criteria for what constitutes a \\nconforming loan. Similarly, there have been various proposals to \\nreform the housing finance market in the U.S., including the role \\nof the GSEs, which, depending on any ultimate reforms enacted, \\ncould have an adverse impact on our mortgage banking business. \\nIn addition, to meet customer needs, we also originate loans that \\ndo not conform to either the GSEs’ or government insuring \\nagencies’ standards, which are generally retained on our balance \\nsheet and therefore do not generate sale proceeds that could be \\nused to originate new loans. \\nFor additional information, see the “Risk Management – \\nAsset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking Interest Rate \\nand Market Risk,” “Critical Accounting Policies – Valuation of \\nResidential Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs)” and “Critical \\nAccounting Policies – Fair Value of Financial Instruments” \\nsections in this Report. \\nWe may suffer losses, penalties, or other adverse \\nconsequences if we fail to satisfy our obligations with respect \\nto the residential mortgage loans or other assets we originate \\nor service.   For residential mortgage loans that we originate, we \\ncould become subject to monetary damages and other civil \\npenalties, including the loss of certain contractual payments or \\nthe inability to exercise certain remedies under the loans such as \\nforeclosure proceedings, if it is alleged or determined that the \\nloans were not originated in accordance with applicable laws or \\nregulations. \\nAdditionally, for residential mortgage loans that we \\noriginate and sell, we may be required to repurchase the loans or \\nindemnify or reimburse the securitization trust, investor or \\ninsurer for credit losses incurred on loans in the event of a breach \\nof contractual representations or warranties in the agreements \\nunder which we sell the loans or in the insurance or guaranty \\nagreements that we enter into with the FHA and VA. If economic \\nconditions or the housing market worsen, we could have \\nincreased repurchase obligations and increased loss severity on \\nrepurchases. We may also have repurchase or other obligations \\nto the extent we originate and securitize other assets, such as \\ncredit card loans. \\nFurthermore, if we fail to satisfy our servicing obligations for \\nthe mortgage loans we service, we may be terminated as servicer \\nor master servicer, required to indemnify the securitization \\ntrustee against losses, and/or contractually obligated to \\nrepurchase a mortgage loan or reimburse investors for credit \\nWells Fargo & Company 79 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We compete with other \\nfinancial institutions in a highly competitive industry that is \\nundergoing significant changes as a result of financial regulatory \\nreform, technological advances, increased public scrutiny, and \\neconomic conditions. Our success depends on, among other \\nthings, our ability to develop and maintain deep and enduring \\nrelationships with our customers based on the quality of our \\ncustomer service, the wide variety of products and services that \\nwe can offer our customers and the ability of those products and \\nservices to satisfy our customers’ needs and preferences, the \\npricing of our products and services, the extensive distribution \\nchannels available for our customers, our innovation, and our \\nreputation. Continued or increased competition in any one or all \\nof these areas may negatively affect our customer relationships, \\nmarket share and results of operations and/or cause us to \\nincrease our capital investment in our businesses in order to \\nremain competitive. In addition, our ability to reposition or \\nreprice our products and services from time to time may be \\nlimited and could be influenced significantly by the economic, \\nregulatory and political environment for large financial \\ninstitutions as well as by the actions of our competitors. \\nFurthermore, any changes in the types of products and services \\nthat we offer our customers and/or the pricing for those \\nproducts and services could result in a loss of customer \\nrelationships and market share and could materially adversely \\naffect our results of operations. \\nContinued technological advances and the growth of \\ne-commerce have made it possible for non-depository \\ninstitutions to offer products and services that traditionally were \\nbanking products, and for financial institutions and other \\ncompanies to provide electronic and internet-based financial \\nsolutions, including electronic securities trading, lending and \\npayment solutions. In addition, technological advances, including \\ndigital currencies and alternative payment methods, may \\ndiminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds between parties. \\nWe may not respond effectively to these and other competitive \\nthreats from existing and new competitors and may be forced to \\noffer products and services at lower prices, increase our \\ninvestment in our business to modify or adapt our existing \\nproducts and services, and/or develop new products and services \\nto respond to our customers’ needs and preferences. To the \\nextent we are not successful in developing and introducing new \\nproducts and services or responding or adapting to the \\ncompetitive landscape or to changes in customer preferences, we \\nmay lose customer relationships and our growth prospects and \\nresults of operations may be materially adversely affected. \\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical \\nto the success of our business and failure to do so could \\nadversely affect our business performance, competitive \\nposition and future prospects. \\xa0 The success of Wells Fargo is \\nheavily dependent on the talents and efforts of our employees, \\nincluding our senior leaders, and in many areas of our business, \\nincluding commercial banking, brokerage, investment advisory, \\ncapital markets, risk management, and technology, the \\ncompetition for highly qualified personnel is intense. We also \\nseek to retain a pipeline of employees to provide continuity of \\nsuccession for our senior leadership positions. In order to attract \\nand retain highly qualified employees, we must provide \\ncompetitive compensation, benefits and work arrangements, \\neffectively manage employee performance and development, \\nand foster a diverse and inclusive environment. As a large \\nfinancial institution and additionally to the extent we remain \\nsubject to consent orders we may be subject to limitations on \\ncompensation by our regulators that may adversely affect our \\nability to attract and retain these qualified employees, especially \\nif some of our competitors may not be subject to these same \\ncompensation limitations. Similarly, union organizing activity, \\nsome of which has been successful, could continue to increase \\nour operational complexity and costs. In addition, our response to \\nthis activity could be perceived negatively and harm our \\nreputation and business, subject us to legal actions, or adversely \\naffect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. If we \\nare unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, \\nincluding successors for senior leadership positions, our business \\nperformance, competitive position and future prospects may be \\nadversely affected. \\nFINANCIAL REPORTING RISKS \\nChanges in accounting standards, and changes in how \\naccounting standards are interpreted or applied, could \\nmaterially affect our financial results and condition.   From time \\nto time the FASB and the SEC update the financial accounting \\nand reporting standards that govern the preparation of our \\nexternal financial statements. In addition, accounting standard \\nsetters and those who interpret the accounting standards (such \\nas the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may update their \\nprevious interpretations or positions on how these standards \\nshould be applied. Changes in financial accounting and reporting \\nstandards and changes in current interpretations are typically \\nbeyond our control, can be hard to predict, and could materially \\naffect our financial results and condition, including requiring a \\nretrospective restatement of prior period financial statements. \\nSimilarly, any change in our accounting policies could also \\nmaterially affect our financial statements.

We provide banking, investment and mortgage \\nproducts and services, as well as consumer and commercial \\nfinance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and \\nother distribution channels to individuals, businesses and \\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in \\ncountries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the \\nCompany,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company \\nand Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. To prepare the financial \\nstatements in conformity with GAAP, management must make \\nestimates based on assumptions about future economic and \\nmarket conditions (for example, unemployment, market liquidity, \\nreal estate prices, etc.) that affect the reported amounts of \\nassets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, \\nincome and expenses during the reporting period and the related \\ndisclosures. Although our estimates contemplate current \\nconditions and how we expect them to change in the future, it is \\nreasonably possible that actual conditions could be worse than \\nanticipated in those estimates, which could materially affect our \\nresults of operations and financial condition. Management has \\nmade significant estimates in several areas, including: \\n• allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale \\nand Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities)); \\n• valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 16 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n• valuations of financial instruments (Note 15 (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities)); \\n• liability for legal actions (Note 13 (Legal Actions)); \\n• income taxes; and \\n• goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nAccounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \\nIn 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n• Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n• ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \\n• ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers \\n• ASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates \\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required disclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis. \\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans. \\nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \\nexpands an entity’s ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \\nfor interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \\nassets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \\nWe adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023, on a \\nprospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively.

The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566 million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \\nsecurities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities) for additional information about the Company’s \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 14 \\n(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships. \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. \\nASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are accounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and increase accumulated other comprehensive income \\nby $738 million and $20 million, respectively, as of January 1, \\n2021. \\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, and \\nDecember 31, 2021, and the consolidated balance sheet as of \\nDecember 31, 2022.

Our variable \\ninterest arises from contractual, ownership or other monetary \\ninterests in the entity, which change with fluctuations in the fair \\nvalue of the entity’s net assets. We consolidate a VIE if we are the \\nprimary beneficiary, which is when we have both the power to \\ndirect the activities that most significantly impact the VIE and a \\nvariable interest that could potentially be significant to the VIE. \\nTo determine whether or not a variable interest we hold could \\npotentially be significant to the VIE, we consider both qualitative \\nand quantitative factors regarding the nature, size and form of \\nour involvement with the VIE. We assess whether or not we are \\nthe primary beneficiary of a VIE on an ongoing basis. \\nSignificant intercompany accounts and transactions are \\neliminated in consolidation. When we have significant influence \\nover operating and financing decisions for a company but do not \\nown a majority of the voting equity interests, we account for the \\ninvestment using the equity method of accounting, which \\nrequires us to recognize our proportionate share of the \\ncompany’s earnings. If we do not have significant influence, we \\naccount for the equity security under the fair value method, cost \\nmeth od or measurement alternative. \\nNoncontrolling interests represent the portion of net \\nincome and equity attributable to third-party owners of \\nconsolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly-owned by \\nWells Fargo. Substantially all of our noncontrolling interests \\nrelate to our affiliated venture capital businesses. \\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash \\nCash, cash equivalents and restricted cash are included in cash \\nand due from banks and interest-earning deposits from banks on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. Amounts are recorded at \\namortized cost and include cash on hand, cash items in transit, \\nand amounts due from or held with other depository institutions. \\nSee Note 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other \\nRestrictions) for additional information on the restrictions on \\ncash and cash equivalents. Trading Activities \\nWe engage in trading activities to accommodate the investment \\nand risk management activities of our customers. These \\nactivities predominantly occur in our Corporate and Investment \\nBanking reportable operating segment. Trading assets and \\nliabilities include debt securities, equity securities, loans held for \\nsale, derivatives, and short sales, which are reported within our \\nconsolidated balance sheet based on the accounting \\nclassification of the instrument. In addition, certain instruments \\nthat we have elected to account for under the fair value method, \\nsuch as debt securities that are held for investment purposes and \\nstructured debt liabilities, are classified as trading. \\nOur trading assets and liabilities are carried on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet at fair value with changes in fair value \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities within \\nnoninterest income. Interest income and interest expense are \\nrecognized in net interest income. \\nCustomer accommodation trading activities include our \\nactions as an intermediary to buy and sell financial instruments \\nand market-making activities. We also take positions to manage \\nour exposure to customer accommodation activities. We hold \\nfinancial instruments for trading in long positions, as well as short \\npositions, to facilitate our trading activities. As an intermediary, \\nwe interact with market buyers and sellers to facilitate the \\npurchase and sale of financial instruments to meet the \\nanticipated or current needs of our customers. For example, we \\nmay purchase or sell a derivative to a customer who wants to \\nmanage interest rate risk exposure. We typically enter into an \\noffsetting derivative or security position to manage our exposure \\nto the customer transaction. We earn income based on the \\ntransaction price difference between the customer transaction \\nand the offsetting position, which is reflected in earnings where \\nthe fair value changes and related interest income and expense of \\nthe positions are recorded. \\nOur market-making activities include taking long and short \\ntrading positions to facilitate customer order flow. These \\nactivities are typically executed on a short-term basis. As a \\nmarket-maker we earn income due to: (1) the difference \\nbetween the price paid or received for the purchase and sale of \\nthe security (bid-ask spread), (2) the net interest income of the \\npositions, and (3) the changes in fair value of the trading \\npositions held on our consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, we \\nmay enter into separate derivative or security positions to \\nmanage our exposure related to our long and short trading \\npositions taken in our market-making activities. Income earned \\non these market-making activities are reflected in earnings \\nwhere the fair value changes and related interest income and \\nexpense of the positions are recorded.

AFS debt \\nsecurities are measured at fair value, with unrealized gains and \\nlosses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income \\n(AOCI). The amount reported in other comprehensive income \\n(OCI) is net of the allowance for credit losses (ACL) and \\napplicable income taxes. Investments in debt securities for which \\nthe Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to \\nmaturity are classified as HTM. HTM debt securities are \\nmeasured at amortized cost, net of ACL. See Note 3 (Available-\\nfor-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities) for additional \\ninformation. \\nINTEREST INCOME AND GAIN/LOSS RECOGNITION   Unamortized \\npremiums and discounts are recognized in interest income over \\nthe contractual life of the security using the effective interest \\nmethod, except for purchased callable debt securities carried at a \\npremium. For purchased callable debt securities carried at a \\npremium, the premium is amortized into interest income to the \\nnext call date using the effective interest method. As principal \\nrepayments are received on securities (e.g., mortgage-backed \\nsecurities (MBS)), a proportionate amount of the related \\npremium or discount is recognized in income such that the \\neffective interest rate on the remaining portion of the security \\ncontinues unchanged. \\nWe recognize realized gains and losses on the sale of debt \\nsecurities in net gains from trading and securities within \\nnoninterest income using the specific identification method. \\nIMPAIRMENT AND CREDIT LOSSES   Unrealized losses on AFS debt \\nsecurities are driven by a number of factors, including changes in \\ninterest rates and credit spreads which impact most types of \\ndebt securities, and prepayment rates which impact MBS and \\ncollateralized loan obligations (CLO). Additional considerations \\nfor certain types of AFS debt securities include: \\n• Debt securities of U.S. Treasury and federal agencies, \\nincluding federal agency MBS, are not impacted by credit \\nmovements given the explicit or implicit guarantees \\nprovided by the U.S. government. \\n• Debt securities of U.S. states and political subdivisions are \\nmost impacted by changes in the relationship between \\nmunicipal and term funding credit curves rather than by \\nchanges in the credit quality of the underlying securities. \\n• Structured securities, such as MBS and CLO, are also \\nimpacted by changes in projected collateral losses of assets \\nunderlying the security. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis, we recognize impairment in earnings if we \\nhave the intent to sell the security or if it is more likely than not \\nthat we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its \\namortized cost basis . Impairment is recognized in net gains on \\ntrading and securities within noninterest income equal to the \\ndifference between the amortized cost basis, net of ACL, and the \\nfair value of the AFS debt security. Following the recognition of \\nthis impairment, the AFS debt security’s new amortized cost \\nbasis is fair value. \\nFor AFS debt securities where fair value is less than \\namortized cost basis where we did not recognize impairment in \\nearnings, we record an ACL as of the balance sheet date to the extent unrealized loss is due to credit losses. See the “Allowance \\nfor Credit Losses” section in this Note for our accounting policies \\nrelating to the ACL for debt securities, which also includes debt \\nsecurities classified as HTM. \\nTRANSFERS BETWEEN CATEGORIES OF DEBT SECURITIES   Transfers \\nof debt securities from the AFS to HTM classification are \\nrecorded at fair value, and accordingly the amortized cost of the \\nsecurity transferred to HTM is adjusted to fair value. Unrealized \\ngains or losses reported in AOCI at the transfer date are \\namortized into earnings over the same period as the unamortized \\npremiums and discounts using the effective interest method. \\nAny ACL previously recorded under the AFS debt security model \\nis reversed and an ACL under the HTM debt security model is re-\\nestablished. The reversal and re-establishment of the ACL are \\nrecorded in provision for credit losses. \\nTransfers of debt securities from the HTM to AFS \\nclassification are recorded at fair value. The HTM amortized cost \\n(excluding any ACL previously recorded under the HTM debt \\nsecurity model) becomes the AFS amortized cost, and the debt \\nsecurity is remeasured at fair value with the unrealized gains and \\nlosses reported in OCI. Any ACL previously recorded under the \\nHTM debt security model is reversed and an ACL under the AFS \\ndebt security model is re-established. The reversal and re-\\nestablishment of the ACL are recorded in provision expense. \\nTransfers from HTM to AFS are only expected to occur under \\nlimited circumstances. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE, AND CHARGE-OFF POLICIES   We \\ngenerally place debt securities on nonaccrual status using factors \\nsimilar to those described for loans. When we place a debt \\nsecurity on nonaccrual status, we reverse the accrued unpaid \\ninterest receivable against interest income and suspend the \\namortization of premiums and accretion of discounts. If the \\nultimate collectability of the principal is in doubt on a nonaccrual \\ndebt security, any cash collected is first applied to reduce the \\nsecurity’s amortized cost basis to zero, followed by recovery of \\namounts previously charged off, and subsequently to interest \\nincome. Generally, we return a debt security to accrual status \\nwhen all delinquent interest and principal become current under \\nthe contractual terms of the security and collectability of \\nremaining principal and interest is no longer doubtful. \\nOur debt securities are considered past due when \\ncontractually required principal or interest payments have not \\nbeen made on the due dates. \\nOur charge-off policy for debt securities is similar to our \\ncharge-off policy for loans. Subsequent to charge-off, the debt \\nsecurity will be designated as nonaccrual and follow the process \\ndescribed above for any cash received. \\nSecurities and Other Collateralized Financing \\nAgreements \\nResale and repurchase agreements, as well as securities \\nborrowing and lending agreements, are accounted for as \\ncollateralized financing transactions and are recorded at the \\nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest. We monitor the \\nfair value of securities or other assets purchased and sold as well \\nas the collateral pledged and received. Additional collateral is \\npledged or returned to maintain the appropriate collateral \\nposition for the transactions. These financing transactions do not \\ncreate material credit risk given the collateral provided and the \\nrelated monitoring process. \\nWe include securities purchased under securities financing \\nagreements in federal funds sold and securities purchased under \\nresale agreements on our consolidated balance sheet.

See Note 18 \\n(Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities) for \\nadditional information on our offsetting policy. \\nLoans Held for Sale \\nLoans held for sale (LHFS) generally includes originated or \\npurchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale in \\nthe securitization or whole loan market. Residential mortgage \\nLHFS are accounted for at either fair value or the lower of cost or \\nfair value (LOCOM) and may be measured on an individual or pool \\nlevel basis. Commercial LHFS are generally measured at LOCOM, \\nexcept for certain commercial LHFS in our trading business that \\nare used in market-making activities where we have elected the \\nfair value option. Commercial LHFS are generally measured on an \\nindividual basis. See Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) for additional information regarding LHFS fair value \\nmeasurements.   \\nGains and losses on residential and commercial mortgage \\nLHFS are generally recorded in mortgage banking noninterest \\nincome. Gains and losses on trading LHFS are recognized in net \\ngains from trading activities. Gains and losses on other LHFS are \\nrecognized in other noninterest income. Direct loan origination \\ncosts and fees for LHFS under the fair value option are \\nrecognized in earnings at origination. For LHFS recorded at \\nLOCOM, direct loan origination costs and fees are deferred at \\norigination and are recognized in earnings at time of sale. \\nInterest income on LHFS is calculated based upon the note rate \\nof the loan and is recorded in interest income. \\nInterest rate lock commitments to originate mortgage LHFS \\nare accounted for as derivatives and are measured at fair value. \\nWhen a determination is made at the time of commitment to \\noriginate loans as held for investment, it is our intent to hold \\nthese loans to maturity or for the foreseeable future, subject to \\nperiodic review under our management evaluation processes, \\nincluding corporate asset/liability management. If subsequent \\nchanges occur, including changes in interest rates, our business \\nstrategy, or other market conditions, we may change our intent \\nto hold these loans. When management makes this \\ndetermination, we immediately transfer these loans to the LHFS \\nportfolio at LOCOM. \\nLoans \\nLoans are reported at their outstanding principal balances net of \\nany unearned income, cumulative charge-offs, unamortized \\ndeferred fees and costs on originated loans and unamortized \\npremiums or discounts on purchased loans. \\nUnearned income, deferred fees and costs, and discounts \\nand premiums are amortized to interest income generally over \\nthe contractual life of the loan using the effective interest \\nmethod. Loan commitment fees collected at closing are deferred \\nand amortized to noninterest income on a straight-line basis \\nover the commitment period if loan funding is unlikely. Upon \\nfunding, deferred loan commitment fees are amortized to \\ninterest income over the contractual life of the loan. Loans also include financing leases where we are the lessor \\n(see the “Leasing Activity” section in this Note for our accounting \\npolicy for leases) and resale agreements involving collateral other \\nthan securities (see “Securities and Other Collateralized \\nFinancing Agreements” section in this Note for our accounting \\npolicy for other collateralized financing agreements). \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses ) \\nfor additional information regarding our accounting for loans. \\nNONACCRUAL AND PAST DUE LOANS   We generally place loans on \\nnonaccrual status when: \\n• the full and timely collection of interest or principal becomes \\nuncertain (generally based on an assessment of the \\nborrower’s financial condition and the adequacy of collateral, \\nif any), such as in bankruptcy or other circumstances; \\n• they are 90 days (120 days with respect to residential \\nmortgage loans) past due for interest or principal, unless the \\nloan is both well-secured and in the process of collection; \\n• part of the principal balance has been charged off; or \\n• for junior lien mortgage loans, we have evidence that the \\nrelated first lien mortgage may be 120 days past due or in \\nthe process of foreclosure regardless of the junior lien \\ndelinquency status. \\nCredit card loans are not placed on nonaccrual status, but are \\ngenerally fully charged off when the loan reaches 180 days past \\ndue. \\nWhen we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse the \\naccrued unpaid interest receivable against interest income and \\nsuspend amortization of any net deferred fees. If the ultimate \\ncollectability of the recorded loan balance is in doubt on a \\nnonaccrual loan, the cost recovery method is used and cash \\ncollected is applied to first reduce the carrying value of the loan \\nto zero and then as a recovery of prior charge-offs. Otherwise, \\ninterest income may be recognized to the extent cash is received. \\nGenerally, we return a loan to accrual status when all delinquent \\ninterest and principal become current under the terms of the \\nloan agreement and collectability of remaining principal and \\ninterest is no longer doubtful. \\nWe may re-underwrite modified loans at the time of a \\nrestructuring to determine if there is sufficient evidence of \\nsustained repayment capacity based on the borrower’s financial \\nstrength, including documented income, debt to income ratios \\nand other factors. If the borrower has demonstrated \\nperformance under the previous terms and the underwriting \\nprocess shows the capacity to continue to perform under the \\nrestructured terms, the loan will generally remain in accruing \\nstatus. Loans will be placed on nonaccrual status and we may \\nrecord a charge-off if the re-underwriting did not include an \\nevaluation of the borrower’s ability to repay or we believe it is \\nprobable that principal and interest contractually due under the \\nmodified terms of the agreement will not be collectible. Modified \\nloans that are placed on nonaccrual status will generally return to \\naccrual status when repayment of principal and interest is \\nreasonably assured and the borrower has demonstrated a \\nsustained period of performance (generally six consecutive \\nmonths of payments, or equivalent, inclusive of payments made \\nprior to a modification, if applicable). \\nOur loans are considered past due when contractually \\nrequired principal or interest payments have not been made on \\nthe due dates. \\nLOAN CHARGE-OFF POLICIES For commercial loans, we generally \\nfully charge off or charge down to net realizable value (fair value Note 1:   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued) \\n94 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Generally, loans \\nhave been written down to their net realizable value prior to \\nforeclosure. Any further reduction to their net realizable value is \\nrecorded with a charge to the ACL at foreclosure. We allow up to \\n90 days after foreclosure to finalize determination of net \\nrealizable value. Thereafter, changes in net realizable value are recorded to noninterest expense. The net realizable value of \\nthese assets is reviewed and updated periodically depending on \\nthe type of property. Certain government-guaranteed mortgage \\nloans upon foreclosure are included in accounts receivable, not \\nforeclosed assets. These receivables were loans insured by the \\nFederal Housing Administration (FHA) or guaranteed by the \\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) and are measured based on \\nthe balance expected to be recovered from the FHA or VA. \\nAllowance for Credit Losses \\nThe ACL is management’s estimate of the current expected life-\\ntime credit losses in the loan portfolio and unfunded credit \\ncommitments, at the balance sheet date, excluding loans and \\nunfunded credit commitments carried at fair value or held for \\nsale. Additionally, we maintain an ACL for AFS and HTM debt \\nsecurities, other financing receivables measured at amortized \\ncost, and other off-balance sheet credit exposures. While we \\nattribute portions of the allowance to specific financial asset \\nclasses (loan and debt security portfolios), loan portfolio \\nsegments (commercial and consumer) or major security type, the \\nentire ACL is available to absorb credit losses of the Company. \\nOur ACL process involves procedures to appropriately \\nconsider the unique risk characteristics of our financial asset \\nclasses, portfolio segments, and major security types. For each \\nloan portfolio segment and each major HTM debt security type, \\nlosses are estimated collectively for groups of loans or securities \\nwith similar risk characteristics. For loans and securities that do \\nnot share similar risk characteristics with other financial assets, \\nthe losses are estimated individually, which generally includes our \\nnonperforming large commercial loans and non-accruing HTM \\ndebt securities. For AFS debt securities, losses are estimated at \\nthe individual security level. \\nOur ACL amounts are influenced by a variety of factors, \\nincluding changes in loan and debt security volumes, portfolio \\ncredit quality, and general economic conditions. General \\neconomic conditions are forecasted using economic variables \\nwhich will create volatility as those variables change over time. \\nSee Table 1.3 for key economic variables used for our loan \\nportfolios. \\nTable 1.3:   Key Economic Variables \\nLoan Portfolio Key economic variables \\nTotal commercial •       Gross domestic product \\n•       Commercial real estate asset prices, where applicable \\n•       Unemployment rate \\nResidential mortgage •       Home price index \\n•       Unemployment rate \\nOther consumer (including credit card, auto, and other consumer) •       Unemployment rate \\nOur approach for estimating expected life-time credit losses \\nfor loans and debt securities includes the following key \\ncomponents: \\n• An initial loss forecast period of two years for all portfolio \\nsegments and classes of financing receivables and off-\\nbalance-sheet credit exposures. This period reflects \\nmanagement’s expectation of losses based on forward-\\nlooking economic scenarios over that time. We forecast \\nmultiple economic scenarios that generally include a base \\nscenario with an optimistic (upside) and one or more \\npessimistic (downside) scenarios, which are weighted by \\nmanagement to estimate future credit losses. • Long-term average loss expectations estimated by reverting \\nto the long-term average, on a linear basis, for each of the \\neconomic variables forecasted during the initial loss forecast \\nperiod. These long-term averages are based on observations \\nover multiple economic cycles. The reversion period, which \\nmay be up to two years, is assessed on a quarterly basis. \\n• The remaining contractual term of a loan is adjusted for \\nexpected prepayments and certain expected extensions, \\nrenewals, or modifications. We extend the contractual term \\nwhen we are not able to unconditionally cancel contractual \\nrenewals or extension options.

For most HTM \\ndebt securities, the ACL is measured using an expected loss \\nmodel, similar to the methodology used for loans. \\nThe ACL for financial assets held at amortized cost is a \\nvaluation account that is deducted from, or added to, the \\namortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net \\namount expected to be collected. When credit expectations \\nchange, the valuation account is adjusted with changes reported \\nin provision for credit losses. If amounts previously charged off \\nare subsequently expected to be collected, we may recognize a \\nnegative allowance, which is limited to the amount that was \\npreviously charged off. For financial assets with an ACL \\nestimated using DCF methods, changes in the ACL due to the \\npassage of time are recorded in interest income. The ACL for AFS \\ndebt securities reflects the amount of unrealized loss related to \\nexpected credit losses, limited by the amount that fair value is \\nless than the amortized cost basis (fair value floor) and cannot \\nhave an associated negative allowance. \\nFor certain financial assets, such as residential real estate \\nloans guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage \\nAssociation (GNMA), an agency of the federal government, U. S. \\nTreasury and Agency mortgage-backed debt securities and \\ncertain sovereign debt securities, the Company has not \\nrecognized an ACL as our expectation of loss is zero, based on \\nhistorical losses and consideration of current and forecasted \\nconditions. \\nFor financial assets that are collateral-dependent, we use the \\nfair value of the collateral to measure the ACL. If we intend to sell \\nthe underlying collateral, we will measure the ACL based on the \\ncollateral’s net realizable value. In most situations, based on our \\ncharge-off policies, we will immediately write-down the financial \\nasset to the fair value of the collateral or net realizable value. For \\nconsumer loans, collateral-dependent financial assets may have \\ncollateral in the form of residential real estate, autos or other \\npersonal assets. For commercial loans, collateral-dependent \\nfinancial assets may have collateral in the form of commercial \\nreal estate or other business assets. \\nWe do not generally record an ACL for accrued interest \\nreceivables because uncollectible accrued interest is reversed \\nthrough interest income in a timely manner in line with our non-\\naccrual and past due policies for loans and debt securities. For \\nconsumer credit card and certain consumer lines of credit, we \\ninclude an ACL for accrued interest and fees since these loans are \\nneither placed on nonaccrual status nor written off until the loan \\nis 180 days past due. Accrued interest receivables are included in \\nother assets, except for certain revolving loans, such as credit \\ncard loans. \\nCOMMERCIAL LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY   \\nGenerally, commercial loans, which include net investments in \\nlease financing, are assessed for estimated losses by grading each \\nloan using various risk factors as identified through periodic \\nreviews. Our estimation approach for the commercial portfolio \\nreflects the estimated probability of default in accordance with \\nthe borrower’s financial strength and the severity of loss in the \\nevent of default, considering the quality of any underlying \\ncollateral. Probability of default, loss severity at the time of \\ndefault, and exposure at default are statistically derived through \\nhistorical observations of default and losses after default within each credit risk rating. These estimates are adjusted as \\nappropriate for risks identified from current and forecasted \\neconomic conditions and credit quality trends. Unfunded credit \\ncommitments are evaluated based on a conversion factor to \\nderive a funded loan equivalent amount. The estimated \\nprobability of default and loss severity at the time of default are \\napplied to the funded loan equivalent amount to estimate losses \\nfor unfunded credit commitments. \\nCONSUMER LOAN PORTFOLIO SEGMENT ACL METHODOLOGY For \\nconsumer loans, we determine the allowance using a pooled \\napproach based on the individual risk characteristics of the loans \\nwithin those pools. Quantitative modeling methodologies that \\nestimate probability of default, loss severity at the time of \\ndefault and exposure at default are typically leveraged to \\nestimate expected loss. These methodologies pool loans, \\ngenerally by product types with similar risk characteristics, such \\nas residential real estate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. \\nAs appropriate and to achieve greater accuracy, we may further \\nstratify selected portfolios by sub-product, risk pool, loss type, \\ngeographic location and other predictive characteristics. We use \\nattributes such as delinquency status, Fair Isaac Corporation \\n(FICO) scores, and loan-to-value ratios (where applicable) in the \\ndevelopment of our consumer loan models, in addition to home \\nprice trends, unemployment trends, and other economic \\nvariables that may influence the frequency and severity of losses \\nin the consumer portfolio. \\nOTHER QUALITATIVE FACTORS   The ACL includes amounts for \\nqualitative factors which may not be adequately reflected in our \\nloss models. These amounts represent management’s judgment \\nof risks in the processes and assumptions used in establishing the \\nACL. Generally, these amounts are established at a granular level \\nbelow our loan portfolio segments. We also consider economic \\nenvironmental factors, modeling assumptions and performance, \\nprocess risk, and other subjective factors, including industry \\ntrends and emerging risk assessments. \\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURES   Our off-balance sheet \\ncredit exposures include unfunded loan commitments (generally \\nin the form of revolving lines of credit), financial guarantees not \\naccounted for as insurance contracts or derivatives, including \\nstandby letters of credit, and other similar instruments. For off-\\nbalance sheet credit exposures, we recognize an ACL associated \\nwith the unfunded amounts. We do not recognize an ACL for \\ncommitments that are unconditionally cancelable at our \\ndiscretion. Additionally, we recognize an ACL for financial \\nguarantees that create off-balance sheet credit exposure, such as \\nloans sold with credit recourse and factoring guarantees. ACL for \\noff-balance sheet credit exposures are reported as a liability in \\naccrued expenses and other liabilities on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. \\nOTHER FINANCIAL ASSETS   Other financial assets are evaluated \\nfor expected credit losses. These other financial assets include \\naccounts receivable for fees, receivables from government-\\nsponsored entities, such as Federal National Mortgage \\nAssociation (FNMA) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage \\nCorporation (FHLMC), and GNMA, and other accounts \\nreceivables from high-credit quality counterparties, such as \\ncentral clearing counterparties.

A provision for credit losses is not recognized \\nseparately from the regular income or expense associated with \\nthese financial assets. \\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are generally \\nover-collateralized by securities or cash and are generally short-\\nterm in nature. We have elected the practical expedient for these \\nfinancial assets given collateral maintenance provisions. These \\nprovisions require that we monitor the collateral value and \\ncustomers are required to replenish collateral, if needed. \\nAccordingly, we generally do not maintain an ACL for these \\nfinancial assets. \\nSee Note 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) \\nfor additional information. \\nPurchased Credit Deteriorated Financial Assets \\nFinancial assets acquired that are of poor credit quality and with \\nmore than an insignificant evidence of credit deterioration since \\ntheir origination or issuance are purchased credit deteriorated \\n(PCD) assets. PCD assets include HTM and AFS debt securities \\nand loans. PCD assets are recorded at their purchase price plus an \\nACL estimated at the time of acquisition. Under this approach, \\nthere is no provision for credit losses recognized at acquisition; \\nrather, there is a gross-up of the purchase price of the financial \\nasset for the estimate of expected credit losses and a \\ncorresponding ACL recorded. Changes in estimates of expected \\ncredit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for \\ncredit losses in subsequent periods. In general, interest income \\nrecognition for PCD financial assets is consistent with interest \\nincome recognition for the similar non-PCD financial asset. \\nLeasing Activity \\nAS LESSOR   We lease equipment to our customers under \\nfinancing or operating leases. Financing leases, which includes \\nboth direct financing and sales-type leases, are presented in \\nloans and are recorded at the discounted amounts of lease \\npayments receivable plus the estimated residual value of the \\nleased asset. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing \\nleases, are reduced by related non-recourse debt from third-\\nparty investors. Lease payments receivable reflect contractual \\nlease payments adjusted for renewal or termination options that \\nwe believe the customer is reasonably certain to exercise. The \\nresidual value reflects our best estimate of the expected sales \\nprice for the equipment at lease termination based on sales \\nhistory adjusted for recent trends in the expected exit markets. \\nMany of our leases allow the customer to extend the lease at \\nprevailing market terms or purchase the asset for fair value at \\nlease termination. \\nOur allowance for loan losses for financing leases considers \\nboth the collectability of the lease payments receivable as well as \\nthe estimated residual value of the leased asset. We typically \\npurchase residual value insurance on our financing leases to \\nreduce the risk of loss at lease termination. \\nIn connection with a lease, we may finance the customer’s \\npurchase of other products or services from the equipment \\nvendor and allocate the contract consideration between the use \\nof the asset and the purchase of those products or services. \\nAmounts allocated are reported in loans as commercial and \\nindustrial loans, rather than as lease financing. \\nOur primary income from financing leases is interest income \\nrecognized using the effective interest method. Variable lease \\nrevenue, such as reimbursement for property taxes, are included \\nin lease income within noninterest income. Operating lease assets are presented in other assets, net of \\naccumulated depreciation. Periodic depreciation expense is \\nrecorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of \\nthe leased asset and are included in other noninterest expense. \\nOperating lease assets are reviewed periodically for impairment \\nand an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of \\noperating lease assets exceeds fair value and is not recoverable. \\nRecoverability is evaluated by comparing the carrying amount of \\nthe leased assets to undiscounted cash flows expected through \\nthe operation or sale of the asset. Impairment charges for \\noperating lease assets are included in other noninterest income. \\nOperating lease rental income for leased assets is recognized \\nin lease income within noninterest income on a straight-line basis \\nover the lease term. Variable revenue on operating leases include \\nreimbursements of costs, including property taxes, which \\nfluctuate over time, as well as rental revenue based on usage. For \\nleases of railcars, revenue for maintenance services provided \\nunder the lease is recognized in lease income. \\nWe elected to exclude from revenue and expenses any sales \\ntax incurred on lease payments which are reimbursed by the \\nlessee. Substantially all of our leased assets are protected against \\ncasualty loss through third-party insurance. \\nAS LESSEE   We enter into lease agreements to obtain the right to \\nuse assets for our business operations, substantially all of which \\nare real estate. Lease liabilities and right-of-use (ROU) assets are \\nrecognized when we enter into operating or financing leases and \\nrepresent our obligations and rights to use these assets over the \\nperiod of the leases and may be re-measured for certain \\nmodifications. \\nOperating lease liabilities include fixed and in-substance \\nfixed payments for the contractual duration of the lease, \\nadjusted for renewals or terminations which were considered \\nprobable of exercise when measured. The lease payments are \\ndiscounted using a rate that approximates a collateralized \\nborrowing rate for the estimated duration of the lease as the \\nimplicit discount rate is typically not known. The discount rate is \\nupdated when re-measurement events occur. The related \\noperating lease ROU assets may differ from operating lease \\nliabilities due to initial direct costs, deferred or prepaid lease \\npayments and lease incentives. \\nWe present operating lease liabilities in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities and the related operating lease ROU assets in \\nother assets. The amortization of operating lease ROU assets \\nand the accretion of operating lease liabilities are reported \\ntogether as fixed lease expense and are included in occupancy \\nexpense within noninterest expense. The fixed lease expense is \\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. \\nSome operating leases include variable lease payments and \\nare recognized as incurred in net occupancy expense within \\nnoninterest expense. \\nFor substantially all of our leased assets, we account for \\nconsideration paid under the contract for maintenance or other \\nservices as lease payments. We exclude certain asset classes, with \\noriginal terms of less than one year from the operating lease \\nROU assets and lease liabilities. The related short-term lease \\nexpense is included in net occupancy expense. \\nFinance lease liabilities are presented in long-term debt and \\nthe associated finance ROU assets are presented in premises and \\nequipment. \\nSee Note 8 (Leasing Activity) for additional information. \\nWells Fargo & Company 97 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We generally report \\nborrowings with original maturities of one year or less as short-\\nterm borrowings and borrowings with original maturities of \\ngreater than one year as long-term debt on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. We do not reclassify long-term debt to short-\\nterm borrowings within a year of maturity. \\nRefer to Note 9 (Deposits) for further information on \\ndeposits, Note 10 (Long-Term Debt) for further information on \\nlong-term debt, and Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) for additional information on fair value, including fair \\nvalue option elections. \\nSecuritizations and Beneficial Interests \\nSecuritizations are transactions in which financial assets are sold \\nto a Special Purpose Entity (SPE), which then issues beneficial \\ninterests collateralized by the transferred financial assets. \\nBeneficial interests are generally issued in the form of senior and \\nsubordinated interests, and in some cases, we may obtain \\nbeneficial interests issued by the SPE. Additionally, from time to \\ntime, we may re-securitize certain financial assets in a new \\nsecuritization transaction. See Note 16 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) for additional information about our \\ninvolvement with SPEs. \\nThe assets and liabilities transferred to a SPE are excluded \\nfrom our consolidated balance sheet if the transfer qualifies \\nas a sale and we are not required to consolidate the SPE. \\nFor transfers of financial assets recorded as sales, we \\nrecognize and initially measure at fair value all assets obtained \\n(including beneficial interests or mortgage servicing rights) and \\nall liabilities incurred. We record a gain or loss in noninterest \\nincome for the difference between assets obtained (net of \\nliabilities incurred) and the carrying amount of the assets sold. \\nBeneficial interests obtained from, and liabilities incurred in, \\nsecuritizations with off-balance sheet entities may include debt \\nand equity securities, loans, MSRs, derivative assets and \\nliabilities, other assets, and other obligations such as liabilities \\nfor mortgage repurchase losses or long-term debt and are \\naccounted for as described within this Note. \\nMortgage Servicing Rights \\nWe recognize MSRs resulting from a sale or securitization of \\nmortgage loans that we originate or through a direct purchase of \\nsuch rights. We initially record all of our MSRs at fair value. \\nSubsequently, residential loan MSRs are carried at fair value. \\nCommercial MSRs are subsequently measured at LOCOM. The \\nvaluation and sensitivity of MSRs is discussed further in Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets \\nand Liabilities) and Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest \\nEntities). \\nFor MSRs carried at fair value, changes in fair value are \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income in the period \\nin which the change occurs. MSRs subsequently measured at \\nLOCOM are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, \\nestimated net servicing income. The amortization of MSRs is \\nreported in mortgage banking noninterest income, analyzed \\nmonthly and adjusted to reflect changes in prepayment rates, as \\nwell as other factors. \\nMSRs accounted for at LOCOM are periodically evaluated \\nfor impairment based on the fair value of those assets. For \\npurposes of impairment evaluation and measurement, we \\nstratify MSRs based on the predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans, including investor and product type. If, by \\nindividual stratum, the carrying amount of these MSRs exceeds \\nfair value, a valuation allowance is established. The valuation \\nallowance is adjusted as the fair value changes. \\nPremises and Equipment \\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated \\ndepreciation and amortization. We use the straight-line method \\nof depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization \\nexpense for premises and equipment was $1.3 billion in 2023, \\n$1.2 billion in 2022, and $1.4 billion in 2021. Estimated useful \\nlives range up to 40 years for buildings and improvements, up to \\n10 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of the \\nestimated useful life (up to 8 years) or the lease term for \\nleasehold improvements. \\nGoodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill is recorded for business combinations when the \\npurchase price is higher than the fair value of the acquired net \\nassets, including identifiable intangible assets. \\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level \\non an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances. \\nWe have determined that our reporting units are at the \\nreportable operating segment level or one level below. We \\nidentify the reporting units based on how the segments and \\nreporting units are managed, taking into consideration the \\neconomic characteristics, nature of the products and services, \\nand customers of the segments and reporting units. We allocate \\ngoodwill to applicable reporting units based on their relative fair \\nvalue at the time we acquire a business and when we have a \\nsignificant business reorganization. If we sell a business, a portion \\nof goodwill is included with the carrying amount of the divested \\nbusiness. \\nWe have the option of performing a qualitative assessment \\nof goodwill. We may also elect to bypass the qualitative test and \\nproceed directly to a quantitative test. If we perform a qualitative \\nassessment of goodwill to test for impairment and conclude it is \\nmore likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is greater \\nthan its carrying amount, quantitative tests are not required. \\nHowever, if we determine it is more likely than not that a \\nreporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, we \\ncomplete a quantitative assessment to determine if there is \\ngoodwill impairment. We apply various quantitative valuation \\nmethodologies, including discounted cash flow and earnings \\nmultiple approaches, to determine the estimated fair value, \\nwhich is compared with the carrying value of each reporting unit. \\nA goodwill impairment loss is recognized if the fair value is less \\nthan the carrying amount, including goodwill. The goodwill \\nimpairment loss is limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to \\nthe reporting unit. We recognize impairment losses as a charge \\nto other noninterest expense and a reduction to the carrying \\nvalue of goodwill. Subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment \\nare prohibited. \\nWe amortize customer relationship intangible assets on an \\naccelerated basis over useful lives not exceeding 10 years. We \\nreview intangible assets for impairment whenever events or \\nchanges in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts \\nmay not be recoverable. Impairment is indicated if the sum of \\nundiscounted estimated future net cash flows is less than the \\ncarrying value of the asset. Impairment is permanently \\nrecognized by writing down the asset to the extent that the \\ncarrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.

On the date we enter into a derivative \\ncontract, we categorize the derivative as either an accounting \\nhedge, economic hedge, or part of our customer accommodation \\ntrading portfolio. \\nAccounting hedges are either fair value or cash flow hedges. \\nFair value hedges represent the hedge of the fair value of a \\nrecognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm \\ncommitment, including hedges of foreign currency exposure. \\nCash flow hedges represent the hedge of a forecasted \\ntransaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received \\nrelated to a recognized asset or liability. \\nEconomic hedges and customer accommodation trading \\nderivatives do not qualify for, or we have elected not to apply, \\nhedge accounting. Economic hedges are derivatives we \\nuse to manage interest rate, foreign currency and certain other \\nrisks associated with our non-trading activities. Our customer \\naccommodation trading portfolio represents derivatives related \\nto our trading business activities. We report changes in the fair \\nvalues of these derivatives in noninterest income or noninterest \\nexpense. \\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES   We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in income, except for certain derivatives in which a \\nportion is recorded to OCI. We record basis adjustments to the \\namortized cost of the hedged asset or liability due to the changes \\nin fair value related to the hedged risk, except for basis \\nadjustments related to active portfolio layer method hedges \\nwhich are maintained at a portfolio level and not allocated to the \\nindividual assets in the portfolio. The offset to fair value hedge \\nbasis adjustments is recorded in earnings. We present derivative \\ngains or losses in the same income statement category as the \\nhedged asset or liability, as follows: \\n• For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, amounts are \\nreflected in net interest income; \\n• For hedges of foreign currency risk, amounts representing \\nthe fair value changes less the accrual for periodic cash flow \\nsettlements are reflected in noninterest income. The \\nperiodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \\nincome; \\n• For hedges of both interest rate risk and foreign currency \\nrisk, amounts representing the fair value change less the \\naccrual for periodic cash flow settlements is attributed to \\nboth net interest income and noninterest income. The \\nperiodic cash flow settlements are reflected in net interest \\nincome. \\nThe entire derivative gain or loss is included in the \\nassessment of hedge effectiveness for all fair value hedge \\nrelationships, except for hedges of foreign-currency \\ndenominated AFS debt securities and long-term debt liabilities \\nhedged with cross-currency swaps. The change in fair value of \\nthese swaps attributable to cross-currency basis spread changes \\nis excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The \\ninitial fair value of the excluded component is amortized to net \\ninterest income and the difference between changes in fair value \\nof the excluded component and the amount recorded in earnings \\nis recorded in OCI. \\nCASH FLOW HEDGES   We record changes in the fair value of the \\nderivative in OCI. We subsequently reclassify gains and losses \\nfrom these changes in fair value from OCI to earnings in the same \\nperiod(s) that the hedged transaction affects earnings and in the \\nsame income statement category as the hedged item. The entire gain or loss on these derivatives is included in the assessment of \\nhedge effectiveness. \\nDOCUMENTATION AND EFFECTIVENESS ASSESSMENT FOR \\nACCOUNTING HEDGES   For fair value and cash flow hedges \\nqualifying for hedge accounting, we formally document at \\ninception the relationship between hedging instruments and \\nhedged items, our risk management objective, strategy and our \\nevaluation of effectiveness for our hedge transactions. This \\nprocess includes linking all derivatives designated as fair value or \\ncash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet or to specific forecasted transactions. \\nWe assess hedge effectiveness using regression analysis, both at \\ninception of the hedging relationship and on an ongoing basis. \\nFor fair value hedges, the regression analysis involves regressing \\nthe periodic change in fair value of the hedging instrument \\nagainst the periodic changes in fair value of the asset or liability \\nbeing hedged due to changes in the hedged risk(s). For cash flow \\nhedges, the regression analysis involves regressing the periodic \\nchanges in fair value of the hedging instrument against the \\nperiodic changes in fair value of a hypothetical derivative. The \\nhypothetical derivative has terms that identically match and \\noffset the cash flows of the forecasted transaction being hedged \\ndue to changes in the hedged risk(s). The initial assessment for \\nfair value and cash flow hedges includes an evaluation of the \\nquantitative measures of the regression results used to validate \\nthe conclusion of high effectiveness. Periodically, as required, we \\nalso formally assess whether the derivative we designated in \\neach hedging relationship is expected to be and has been highly \\neffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the \\nhedged item using the regression analysis method. \\nFor portfolio layer method fair value hedges, an assessment \\ntest is also performed at inception of the hedging relationship \\nand on an ongoing basis to support our expectation that the \\nhedged item is anticipated to be outstanding for the designated \\nhedge period. \\nDISCONTINUING HEDGE ACCOUNTING We discontinue hedge \\naccounting prospectively when (1) a derivative is no longer highly \\neffective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a \\nhedged item, (2) a derivative expires or is sold, terminated or \\nexercised, (3) we elect to discontinue hedge accounting, (4) the \\nforecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring in a \\ncash flow hedge, or (5) the hedged item is no longer anticipated \\nto be outstanding for the designated hedge period in a portfolio \\nlayer method hedge. \\nWhen we discontinue fair value hedge accounting for \\nportfolio layer method hedges, the associated portfolio level \\nbasis adjustment is allocated to the remaining securities in the \\nportfolio on a proportionate basis. Upon discontinuance of all \\nother fair value hedges, we no longer adjust the previously \\nhedged asset or liability for changes in fair value. \\nThe remaining cumulative adjustments to the hedged item \\nand accumulated amounts reported in OCI are accounted for in \\nthe same manner as other components of the carrying amount \\nof the asset or liability. For example, for financial debt \\ninstruments such as AFS debt securities, loans or long-term debt, \\nthese amounts are amortized into net interest income over the \\nremaining life of the asset or liability similar to other amortized \\ncost basis adjustments. If the hedged item is derecognized, the \\naccumulated amounts reported in OCI are immediately \\nreclassified to net interest income. If the derivative continues to \\nbe held after fair value hedge accounting ceases, we carry the \\nderivative on the consolidated balance sheet at its fair value with \\nchanges in fair value included in noninterest income. \\nWells Fargo & Company 99 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

At inception \\nof the financial instrument, we assess (1) if the economic \\ncharacteristics of the embedded derivative are not clearly and \\nclosely related to the economic characteristics of the host \\ncontract, (2) if the financial instrument that embodies both the \\nembedded derivative and the host contract is not measured at \\nfair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings, and (3) if \\na separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded \\ninstrument would meet the definition of a derivative.

The bifurcated derivative is carried at \\nfair value and accounted for in accordance with its categorization \\nas an accounting hedge, economic hedge, or customer \\naccommodation trading derivative. The accounting for the \\nremaining host contract is the same as other assets and liabilities \\nof a similar type and reported on our consolidated balance sheet \\nbased upon the accounting classification of the instrument. \\nCOUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK AND NETTING   By using derivatives, \\nwe are exposed to counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that \\ncounterparties to the derivative contracts do not perform as \\nexpected. If a counterparty fails to perform, our counterparty \\ncredit risk is equal to the amount reported as a derivative asset \\non our consolidated balance sheet. The amounts reported as a \\nderivative asset are derivative contracts in a gain position, and to \\nthe extent subject to legally enforceable master netting \\narrangements, net of derivatives in a loss position with the same \\ncounterparty and cash collateral received. We minimize \\ncounterparty credit risk through credit approvals, limits, \\nmonitoring procedures, executing master netting arrangements \\nand obtaining collateral, where appropriate. Counterparty credit \\nrisk related to derivatives is considered in determining fair value \\nand our assessment of hedge effectiveness. To the extent \\nderivatives subject to master netting arrangements meet the \\napplicable requirements, including determining the legal \\nenforceability of the arrangement, it is our policy to present \\nderivative balances and related cash collateral amounts net on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. We incorporate adjustments to \\nreflect counterparty credit risk (credit valuation adjustments \\n(CVA)) in determining the fair value of our derivatives. CVA, \\nwhich considers the effects of enforceable master netting \\nagreements and collateral arrangements, reflects market-based \\nviews of the credit quality of each counterparty. We estimate \\nCVA based on observed credit spreads in the credit default swap \\nmarket and indices indicative of the credit quality of the \\ncounterparties to our derivatives. Cash collateral exchanged related to our interest rate \\nderivatives, and certain commodity and equity derivatives, with \\ncentrally cleared counterparties is recorded as a reduction of the \\nderivative fair value asset and liability balances, as opposed to \\nseparate non-derivative receivables or payables. This cash \\ncollateral, also referred to as variation margin, is exchanged \\nbased upon derivative fair value changes, typically on a one-day \\nlag. For additional information on our derivatives and hedging \\nactivities, see Note 14 (Derivatives). \\nEquity Securities \\nEquity securities exclude investments that represent a \\ncontrolling interest in the investee. Marketable equity securities \\nhave readily determinable fair values and are predominantly used \\nin our trading activities. Marketable equity securities are \\nrecorded at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and \\nlosses recognized in net gains from trading and securities in \\nnoninterest income. Dividend income from marketable equity \\nsecurities is recognized in interest income. \\nNonmarketable equity securities do not have readily \\ndeterminable fair values. These securities are accounted for \\nunder one of the following accounting methods: \\n• Fair value through net income: This method is an election. \\nThe securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains \\nor losses recognized in net gains from trading and securities \\nin noninterest income; \\n• Equity method: This method is applied when we have the \\nability to exert significant influence over the investee. The \\nsecurities are recorded at cost and adjusted for our share of \\nthe investee’s earnings or losses, less any dividends received \\nand/or impairment. Equity method adjustments for our \\nshare of the investee’s earnings or losses are recognized in \\nother noninterest income and dividends are recognized as a \\nreduction of the investment carrying value; \\n• Proportional amortization method: This method is applied to \\ncertain low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) investments. \\nThe investments are initially recorded at cost and amortized \\nin proportion to the tax credits received. The amortization of \\nthe investments and the related tax impacts are recognized \\nin income tax expense; \\n• Cost method: This method is required for specific securities, \\nsuch as Federal Reserve Bank stock and Federal Home Loan \\nBank stock. These securities are held at cost less any \\nimpairment; \\n• Measurement alternative: This method is followed by all \\nremaining nonmarketable equity securities. These securities \\nare initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value \\nas of the date of an orderly observable transaction of the \\nsame or similar security of the same issuer. These securities \\nare also adjusted for impairment. \\nAll realized and unrealized gains and losses, including \\nimpairment losses, from nonmarketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net gains from trading and securities in noninterest \\nincome. Dividend income from all nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities, other than equity method securities, is recognized in \\ninterest income. \\nOur review for impairment for nonmarketable equity \\nsecurities not carried at fair value includes an analysis of the facts \\nand circumstances of each security, the intent or requirement to \\nsell the security, the expectations of cash flows, capital needs and \\nthe viability of its business model.

When \\nthe fair value of an investment accounted for using the \\nmeasurement alternative is less than its carrying value, we write-\\ndown the asset to fair value, without the consideration of \\nanticipated recovery. \\nSee Note 4 (Equity Securities) for additional information. \\nPension Accounting \\nWe sponsor a frozen noncontributory qualified defined benefit \\nretirement plan, the Wells Fargo & Company Cash Balance Plan \\n(Cash Balance Plan), which covers eligible employees of \\nWells Fargo. We also sponsor nonqualified defined benefit plans \\nthat provide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to \\ncertain eligible employees. We account for our defined benefit \\npension plans using an actuarial model. Principal assumptions \\nused in determining the net periodic pension cost and the \\npension obligation include the discount rate, the expected long-\\nterm rate of return on plan asset s and projected mortality rates. \\nA single weighted-average discount rate is used to estimate \\nthe present value of our future pension benefit obligations. We \\ndetermine the discount rate using a yield curve derived from a \\nbroad-based population of high-quality corporate bonds with \\nmaturity dates that closely match the estimated timing of the \\nexpected benefit payments. \\nWe use the full year curve approach to estimate the interest \\ncost component of pension expense for our principal defined \\nbenefit and postretirement plans. The full yield curve approach \\naligns specific spot rates along the yield curve to the projected \\nbenefit payment cash flows. \\nThe determination of our expected long-term rate of return \\non plan assets is highly quantitative by nature. We evaluate the \\ncurrent asset allocations and expected returns using forward-\\nlooking capital market assumptions. We use the resulting \\nprojections to derive a baseline expected rate of return for the \\nCash Balance Plan’s prescribed asset mix. \\nMortality rate assumptions are based on mortality tables \\npublished by the Society of Actuaries adjusted to reflect our \\nspecific experience. \\nAt year end, we re-measure our defined benefit plan \\nliabilities and related plan assets and recognize any resulting \\nactuarial gain or loss in OCI. We generally amortize net actuarial \\ngain or loss in excess of a 5% corridor from AOCI into net periodic \\npension cost over the estimated average remaining participation \\nperiod, which at December 31, 2023, is 17 years. See Note 22 \\n(Employee Benefits) for additional information on our pension \\naccounting. \\nIncome Taxes \\nWe file income tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we \\noperate and evaluate income tax expense in two components: \\ncurrent and deferred income tax expense. Current income tax \\nexpense represents our estimated taxes to be paid or refunded \\nfor the current period and includes income tax expense related to \\nuncertain tax positions. Uncertain tax positions that meet the \\nmore likely than not recognition threshold are measured to \\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize. An uncertain tax \\nposition is measured at the largest amount of benefit that \\nmanagement believes has a greater than 50% likelihood of \\nrealization upon settlement. Tax benefits not meeting our \\nrealization criteria represent unrecognized tax benefits. \\nDeferred income taxes are based on the balance sheet \\nmethod and deferred income tax expense results from changes \\nin deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. Under the \\nbalance sheet method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between the book and \\ntax basis of assets and liabilities, and enacted changes in tax rates \\nand laws are recognized in the period in which they occur. \\nDeferred tax assets are recognized subject to management’s \\njudgment that realization is more likely than not. A valuation \\nallowance reduces deferred tax assets to the realizable amount. \\nSee Note 23 (Income Taxes) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport for a further description of our provision for income taxes \\nand related income tax assets and liabilities. \\nStock-Based Compensation \\nOur long-term incentive plans provide awards for employee \\nservices in various forms, such as restricted share rights (RSRs) \\nand performance share awards (PSAs). \\nStock-based awards are measured at fair value on the grant \\ndate. The cost is recognized in personnel expense, net of actual \\nforfeitures, in our consolidated statement of income normally \\nover the vesting period of the award; awards with graded vesting \\nare expensed on a straight-line method. Awards to employees \\nwho are retirement eligible at the grant date are subject to \\nimmediate expensing upon grant. Awards to employees who \\nbecome retirement eligible before the final vesting date are \\nexpensed between the grant date and the date the employee \\nbecomes retirement eligible. Except for retirement and other \\nlimited circumstances, RSRs are canceled when employment \\nends. \\nFor PSAs, compensation expense fluctuates based on the \\nestimated outcome of meeting the performance conditio ns. The \\ntotal expense that will be recognized on these awards is finalized \\nupon the completion of the performance period. \\nFor additional information on our stock-based employee \\ncompensation plans, see Note 12 (Common Stock and Stock \\nPlans). \\nEarnings Per Common Share \\nWe compute earnings per common share by dividing net income \\napplicable to common stock (net income less dividends on \\npreferred stock and the excess of consideration transferred over \\ncarrying value of preferred stock redeemed, if any) by the \\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the \\nperiod. We compute diluted earnings per common share using \\nnet income applicable to common stock and adding the effect of \\ncommon stock equivalents (e.g., restricted share rights) that are \\ndilutive to the average number of common shares outstanding \\nduring the period. \\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities \\nFair value represents the price that would be received to sell an \\nasset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction \\nbetween market participants at the measurement date. Fair \\nvalue is based on an exit price notion that maximizes the use of \\nobservable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. \\nWe measure our assets and liabilities at fair value when we \\nare required to record them at fair value, when we have elected \\nthe fair value option, and to fulfill fair value disclosure \\nrequirements. Assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on a \\nrecurring or nonrecurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis require a fair value \\nmeasurement at each reporting period. Assets and liabilities that \\nare recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis are adjusted to \\nfair value only as required through the application of an \\naccounting method such as LOCOM, write-downs of individual \\nassets, or application of the measurement alternative for certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities. \\nWells Fargo & Company 101 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Loan \\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\\nto-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \\nloan portfolio segment. \\nMany of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \\nis an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \\nour ACL for consumer loans. \\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are \\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. \\nLTV is the ratio of the outstanding loan balance divided by \\nthe property collateral value. For junior lien mortgages, we use \\nthe total combined loan balance of first and junior lien mortgages \\n(including unused line of credit amounts). We obtain LTVs using a \\ncascade approach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1.5 million or more as of December 31, 2023, and \\n$1.0 million or more as of December 31, 2022, as the AVM values \\nhave proven less accurate for these properties. Generally, we \\nupdate LTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an \\nLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions.

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis. \\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower’s \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $109 million at December 31, 2023. Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. \\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification.

In October 2023, the 401(k) Plan fully repaid all \\nloans to the Company, which resulted in the release of the shares \\nfrom the unallocated reserve of the 401(k) Plan. Released \\ncommon stock is allocated to the 401(k) Plan participants and \\ninvested in the Wells Fargo ESOP Fund within the 401(k) Plan. \\nDividends on the allocated common shares reduce retained \\nearnings, and the shares are considered outstanding for \\ncomputing earnings per share. \\nUnreleased shares were reflected on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet as unearned ESOP shares.

As previously \\ndisclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \\nthe Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, \\nparticipants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class \\naction in the United States District Court for the District of \\nMinnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \\ncertain of these transactions. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS   Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the SEC, have \\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations \\nregarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. The \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the SEC have since \\nclosed their investigations without taking action. A putative \\nsecurities fraud class action has also been filed in the United \\nStates District Court for the Northern District of California \\nalleging that the Company and certain of its executive officers \\nmade false or misleading statements about the Company’s hiring \\npractices related to diversity. Allegations related to the \\nCompany’s hiring practices related to diversity are also among \\nthe subjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits pending in the \\nUnited States District Court for the Northern District of \\nCalifornia and in the Delaware Court of Chancery. INTERCHANGE LITIGATION   Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \\nmerchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \\nwith Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \\nMasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \\ncompanies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \\nactions have been consolidated in the United States District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \\non alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \\ndamages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \\nthat Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \\ntying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \\nanticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \\ndefendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other \\nentities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \\nInterchange Litigation. On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \\nconsolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \\n$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \\nopting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \\ndefault interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November 30, 2016, the \\ndistrict court appointed lead class counsel for a damages class \\nand an equitable relief class. The parties have entered into a \\nsettlement agreement to resolve the damages class claims \\npursuant to which defendants will pay a total of approximately \\n$6.2 billion, which includes approximately $5.3 billion of funds \\nremaining from the 2012 settlement and $900 million in \\nadditional funding. The Company’s allocated responsibility for \\nthe additional funding is approximately $94.5 million. The court \\ngranted final approval of the settlement on December 13, 2019, \\nwhich was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the \\nSecond Circuit by settlement objector merchants.

Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \\nand Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \\ncourt. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \\ncauses of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s \\nalleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of \\nmortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \\nand warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \\nabide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \\nof default. In July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \\nLight’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by \\nCommerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \\ncase in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix \\nLight and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s \\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \\nCircuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, \\nterminating its case. In November 2023, the Company entered \\ninto an agreement with IKB to resolve IKB’s claims. The Company \\npreviously settled two class actions filed by institutional \\ninvestors and an action filed by the National Credit Union \\nAdministration with similar allegations. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION   The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. OUTLOOK   As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.7 billion as of \\nDecember 31, 2023. The outcomes of legal actions are \\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is \\ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \\neven possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \\namount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \\nprobable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \\nAccordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \\ninformation currently available, advice of counsel, available \\ninsurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \\nbelieves that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \\nFargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s \\nconsolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \\nultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \\nto Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 139', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We \\ndesignate certain derivatives as hedging instruments in \\nqualifying hedge accounting relationships (fair value or cash flow \\nhedges). Our remaining derivatives consist of economic hedges \\nthat do not qualify for hedge accounting and derivatives held for \\ncustomer accommodation trading purposes. \\nRisk Management Derivatives \\nOur asset/liability management approach to interest rate, \\nforeign currency and certain other risks includes the use of \\nderivatives, which are typically designated as fair value or cash \\nflow hedges, or economic hedges. We use derivatives to help \\nminimize significant, unplanned fluctuations in earnings, fair \\nvalues of assets and liabilities, and cash flows caused by interest \\nrate, foreign currency and other market risk volatility. This \\napproach involves modifying the repricing characteristics of \\ncertain assets and liabilities so that changes in interest rates, \\nforeign currency and other exposures, which may cause the \\nhedged assets and liabilities to gain or lose fair value, do not have \\na significant adverse effect on the net interest margin, cash flows \\nand earnings. Customer Accommodation Trading \\nWe also use various derivatives, including interest rate, \\ncommodity, equity, credit and foreign exchange contracts, \\nas an accommodation to our customers as part of our trading \\nbusinesses. These derivative transactions, which involve \\nengaging in market-making activities or acting as an \\nintermediary, are conducted in an effort to help customers \\nmanage their market risks. We usually offset our exposure from \\nsuch derivatives by entering into other financial contracts, such \\nas separate derivative or security transactions. \\nTable 14.1 presents the total notional or contractual amounts \\nand fair values for our derivatives. Derivative transactions can be \\nmeasured in terms of the notional amount, but this amount is \\nnot recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and is not, when \\nviewed in isolation, a meaningful measure of the risk profile of \\nthe instruments. The notional amount is generally not \\nexchanged, but is used only as the basis on which derivative cash \\nflows are determined. \\nTable 14.1:   Notional or Contractual Amounts and Fair Values of Derivatives \\nDecember 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 \\nNotional \\nor contractual \\namount Fair value Notional \\nor contractual \\namount Fair value \\nDerivative \\nassets Derivative \\nliabilities Derivative \\nassets Derivative \\nliabilities (in millions) \\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments \\nInterest rate contracts $ 357,096 639 570 263,876 670 579 \\nCommodity contracts 2,600 24 12 1,681 9 25 \\nForeign exchange contracts 4,193 60 395 15,544 161 1,015 \\nTotal derivatives designated as qualifying hedging instruments 723 977 840 1,619 \\nDerivatives not designated as hedging instruments \\nInterest rate contracts 10,409,720 31,806 36,312 10,222,027 40,416 42,894 \\nCommodity contracts 88,491 2,717 2,734 96,001 5,991 3,420 \\nEquity contracts (1) 438,458 13,305 13,810 393,753 9,573 8,254 \\nForeign exchange contracts 2,273,383 24,707 26,762 1,513,363 22,052 25,671 \\nCredit contracts 60,439 113 44 45,649 66 36 \\nTotal derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 72,648 79,662 78,098 80,275 \\nTotal derivatives before netting 73,371 80,639 78,938 81,894 \\nNetting (55,148) (62,144) (56,164) (61,827) \\nTotal $ 18,223 18,495 22,774 20,067 \\n(1) In first quarter 2023, we adopted ASU 2018-12 – Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts .

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert \\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of \\ndeposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nrisk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure \\nto foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the \\nissuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in other assets on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet. In addition, we use interest rate swaps, cross-\\ncurrency swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward \\ncontracts to hedge against changes in fair value of certain \\ninvestments in available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities due to \\nchanges in interest rates, foreign currency rates, or both. For \\ncertain fair value hedges of interest rate risk, we use the portfolio \\nlayer method to hedge stated amounts of closed portfolios of \\nAFS debt securities. For certain fair value hedges of foreign \\ncurrency risk, changes in fair value of cross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency basis spreads are \\nexcluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and \\nrecorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 25 \\n(Other Comprehensive Income) for the amounts recognized in \\nother comprehensive income. \\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in \\ninterest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated \\nlong-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $698 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at December 31, 2023, will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths. For cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2023, we are \\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the \\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for \\na maximum of approximately 9 years.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading \\nor AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 15.1 in this Note. \\nAdditionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments \\non a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments \\ntypically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \\n(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \\napplication of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis are presented in Table 15.4 in this Note. We provide in \\nTable 15.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \\nare not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \\ncarried at amortized cost. \\nFAIR VALUE HIERARCHY   We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \\nbased on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \\nlowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in this Report for a detailed \\ndescription of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \\nconsider all available information, including observable market \\ndata, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \\nused. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nthe unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \\nconsidered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \\nmeasure fair value. Marketable equity securities with published \\nNAVs are classified in the fair value hierarchy. \\nAssets \\nTRADING DEBT SECURITIES Trading debt securities are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. These securities are valued using \\ninternal trader prices that are subject to independent price \\nverification procedures, which includes comparing internal trader \\nprices against multiple independent pricing sources, such as \\nprices obtained from third-party pricing services, observed \\ntrades, and other approved market data. These pricing services \\ncompile prices from various sources and may apply matrix pricing \\nfor similar securities when no price is observable. We review \\npricing methodologies provided by pricing services to determine \\nif observable market information is being used versus \\nunobservable inputs. When evaluating the appropriateness of an \\ninternal trader price, compared with other independent pricing \\nsources, considerations include the range and quality of available \\ninformation and observability of trade data. These sources are \\nused to evaluate the reasonableness of a trader price; however, \\nvaluing financial instruments involves judgments acquired from \\nknowledge of a particular market. Substantially all of our trading \\ndebt securities are recorded using internal trader prices. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT SECURITIES \\xa0\\xa0AFS debt securities are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value \\nmeasurement for AFS debt securities is based upon various \\nsources of market pricing. Where available, we use quoted prices \\nin active markets. When instruments are traded in secondary \\nmarkets and quoted prices in active markets do not exist for such \\nsecurities, we use prices obtained from third-party pricing \\nservices and, to a lesser extent, may use prices obtained from \\nindependent broker-dealers (brokers), collectively vendor prices. \\nSubstantially all of our AFS debt securities are recorded using \\nvendor prices. See the “Level 3 Asset and Liability Valuation \\nProcesses – Vendor Developed Valuations” section in this Note \\nfor additional discussion of our processes when using vendor \\nprices to record fair value of AFS debt securities, which includes \\nthose classified as Level 2 or Level 3 within the fair value \\nhierarchy. \\nWhen vendor prices are deemed inappropriate, they may be \\nadjusted based on other market data or internal models. We also \\nuse internal models when no vendor prices are available. Internal \\nmodels use discounted cash flow techniques or market \\ncomparable pricing techniques. \\nLOANS HELD FOR SALE (LHFS)   LHFS generally includes originated \\nor purchased commercial and residential mortgage loans for sale \\nin the securitization or whole loan market. A significant portion \\nof residential LHFS, and our portfolio of commercial LHFS in our \\ntrading business, are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. \\nThe remaining LHFS are held at LOCOM which may be written \\ndown to fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value for LHFS \\nthat are not part of our trading business is based on quoted \\nmarket prices, where available, or the prices for other mortgage \\nwhole loans with similar characteristics. We may use \\nsecuritization prices that are adjusted for typical securitization \\nactivities including servicing value, portfolio composition, market \\nconditions and liquidity. Fair value for LHFS in our trading \\nbusiness is based on pending transactions when available. Where \\nmarket pricing data or pending transactions are not available, we \\nuse a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. \\nLOANS   Although loans are recorded at amortized cost, we record \\nnonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect write-downs that \\nare based on the observable market price of the loan or current \\nappraised value of the collateral less costs to sell. \\nMORTGAGE SERVICING RIGHTS (MSRs)   Residential MSRs are \\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis. Commercial MSRs are \\ncarried at LOCOM and may be written down to fair value on a \\nnonrecurring basis. MSRs do not trade in an active market with \\nreadily observable prices.

Other than certain exchange-traded derivatives that are \\nactively traded and valued using quoted market prices, \\nderivatives are measured using internal valuation techniques. \\nThese instruments, which include derivatives traded in over-the-\\ncounter (OTC) markets, with clearinghouses, and on exchanges, \\nare classified as Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, \\ndepending on the significance of unobservable inputs in the \\nvaluation. Valuation techniques and inputs to internal models \\ndepend on the type of derivative and nature of the underlying \\nrate, price or index upon which the value of the derivative is \\nbased. Key inputs can include yield curves, credit curves, foreign \\nexchange rates, prepayment rates, volatility measurements and \\ncorrelation of certain of these inputs. \\nEQUITY SECURITIES   Marketable equity securities and certain \\nnonmarketable equity securities that we have elected to account \\nfor at fair value are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Our \\nremaining nonmarketable equity securities are accounted for \\nusing the equity method, cost method or measurement \\nalternative and can be subject to nonrecurring fair value \\nadjustments to record impairment. Additionally, the carrying \\nvalue of equity securities accounted for under the measurement \\nalternative is also remeasured to fair value upon the occurrence \\nof orderly observable transactions of the same or similar \\nsecurities of the same issuer. \\nWe use quoted prices to determine the fair value of \\nmarketable equity securities, as the securities are publicly traded. \\nQuoted prices are typically not available for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. We therefore use other methods, generally \\nmarket comparable pricing techniques, to determine fair value \\nfor such securities. We use all available information in making this \\ndetermination, which includes observable transaction prices for \\nthe same or similar security, prices from third-party pricing \\nservices, broker quotes, trading multiples of comparable public \\ncompanies, and discounted cash flow models. Where appropriate, \\nwe make adjustments to observed market data to reflect the \\ncomparative differences between the market data and the \\nattributes of our equity security, such as differences with public \\ncompanies and other investment-specific considerations like \\nliquidity, marketability or differences in terms of the \\ninstruments. OTHER ASSETS Other assets are generally recorded at amortized \\ncost, with the exception of market risk benefit assets which are \\nrecorded at fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the \\ncontract level using a discounted cash flow model. For the \\nremaining other assets recorded at amortized cost, we also \\nrecord nonrecurring fair value adjustments to reflect impairment \\nor the impact of certain lease modifications. Other assets subject \\nto nonrecurring fair value measurements include operating lease \\nROU assets, foreclosed assets and physical commodities. For \\nthese assets, fair value is generally based upon independent \\nmarket prices or appraised values less costs to sell, or the use of a \\ndiscounted cash flow model. \\nLiabilities \\nSHORT-SALE AND OTHER LIABILITIES Short-sale trading liabilities \\nin our trading business are recorded at fair value on a recurring \\nbasis and are measured using quoted prices in active markets, \\nwhere available. When quoted prices for the same instruments \\nare not available or markets are not active, fair values are \\nestimated using recent trades of similar securities. Other \\nliabilities include market risk benefit liabilities, which are recorded \\nat fair value on a recurring basis and valued at the contract level \\nusing a discounted cash flow model. \\nINTEREST-BEARING DEPOSITS AND LONG-TERM DEBT   Although \\ninterest-bearing deposits and long-term debt are generally \\nrecorded at amortized cost, we have elected the fair value option \\nfor certain structured notes issued by our trading business. Fair \\nvalues for these instruments are estimated using a discounted \\ncash flow model that includes both the embedded derivative and \\ndebt portions of the notes. The discount rate used in these \\ndiscounted cash flow models also incorporates the impact of our \\ncredit spread, which is generally based on observable spreads in \\nthe secondary bond market. \\nWells Fargo & Company 147 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our valuation processes vary depending \\non which approach is utilized. \\nINTERNAL MODEL VALUATIONS Certain Level 3 fair value \\nestimates are based on internal models, such as discounted cash \\nflow or market comparable pricing techniques. Some of the \\ninputs used in these valuations are unobservable. Unobservable \\ninputs are generally derived from or can be correlated to historic \\nperformance of similar portfolios or previous market trades in \\nsimilar instruments where particular unobservable inputs may be \\nimplied. We attempt to correlate each unobservable input to \\nhistorical experience and other third-party data where available. \\nInternal models are subject to review prescribed within our \\nmodel risk management policies and procedures, which include \\nmodel validation. Model validation helps ensure our models are \\nappropriate for their intended use and appropriate controls exist \\nto help mitigate risk of invalid valuations. Model validation \\nassesses the adequacy and appropriateness of our models, \\nincluding reviewing its key components, such as inputs, \\nprocessing components, logic or theory, output results and \\nsupporting model documentation. Validation also includes \\nensuring significant unobservable model inputs are appropriate \\ngiven observable market transactions or other market data \\nwithin the same or similar asset classes. We also have ongoing \\nmonitoring procedures in place for our Level 3 assets and \\nliabilities that use internal valuation models. These procedures, \\nwhich are designed to provide reasonable assurance that models \\ncontinue to perform as expected, include: \\n• ongoing analysis and benchmarking to market transactions \\nand other independent market data (including pricing \\nvendors, if available); \\n• back-testing of modeled fair values to actual realized \\ntransactions; and \\n• review of modeled valuation results against expectations, \\nincluding review of significant or unusual fluctuations in \\nvalue. We update model inputs and methodologies periodically to \\nreflect these monitoring procedures. Additionally, existing \\nmodels are subject to periodic reviews and we perform full model \\nrevalidations as necessary. \\nInternal valuation models are subject to ongoing review by \\nthe appropriate principal line of business or enterprise function \\nand monitoring oversight by Independent Risk Management. \\nIndependent Risk Management, through its Model Risk function, \\nprovides independent oversight of model risk management, and \\nits responsibilities include governance, validation, periodic review, \\nand monitoring of model risk across the Company and providing \\nperiodic reports to management and the Board’s Risk \\nCommittee. \\nVENDOR-DEVELOPED VALUATIONS We routinely obtain pricing \\nfrom third-party vendors to value our assets or liabilities. In \\ncertain limited circumstances, this includes assets and liabilities \\nthat we classify as Level 3. We have processes in place to approve \\nand periodically review third-party vendors to assess whether \\ninformation obtained and valuation techniques used are \\nappropriate. This review may consist of, among other things, \\nobtaining and evaluating control reports issued and pricing \\nmethodology materials distributed. We monitor and review \\nvendor prices on an ongoing basis to evaluate whether the fair \\nvalues are reasonable and in line with market experience in \\nsimilar asset classes. While the inputs used to determine fair \\nvalue are not provided by the pricing vendors, and therefore \\nunavailable for our review, we perform one or more of the \\nfollowing procedures to validate the pricing information and \\ndetermine appropriate classification within the fair value \\nhierarchy: \\n• comparison to other pricing vendors (if available); \\n• variance analysis of prices; \\n• corroboration of pricing by reference to other independent \\nmarket data, such as market transactions and relevant \\nbenchmark indices; \\n• review of pricing by Company personnel familiar with market \\nliquidity and other market-related conditions; and \\n• investigation of prices on a specific instrument-by-\\ninstrument basis.

Option models \\nestimate the likelihood of the specified event occurring by \\nincorporating assumptions such as volatility estimates, price \\nof the underlying instrument and expected rate of return. \\nThe unobservable inputs presented in the previous tables are \\nthose we consider significant to the fair value of the Level 3 asset \\nor liability. We consider unobservable inputs to be significant if \\nby their exclusion the fair value of the Level 3 asset or liability \\nwould be impacted by a predetermined percentage change. We \\nalso consider qualitative factors, such as nature of the \\ninstrument, type of valuation technique used, and the \\nsignificance of the unobservable inputs relative to other inputs \\nused within the valuation. Following is a description of the \\nsignificant unobservable inputs provided in the table. \\n• Comparability adjustment – is an adjustment made to \\nobserved market data, such as a transaction price to reflect \\ndissimilarities in underlying collateral, issuer, rating, or other \\nfactors used within a market valuation approach, expressed \\nas a percentage of an observed price. \\n• Conversion factor – is the risk-adjusted rate in which a \\nparticular instrument may be exchanged for another \\ninstrument upon settlement, expressed as a percentage \\nchange from a specified rate. \\n• Correlation factor – is the likelihood of one instrument \\nchanging in price relative to another based on an established \\nrelationship expressed as a percentage of relative change in \\nprice over a period over time. \\n• Cost to service – is the expected cost per loan of servicing a \\nportfolio of loans, which includes estimates for \\nunreimbursed expenses (including delinquency and \\nforeclosure costs) that may occur as a result of servicing \\nsuch loan portfolios. \\n• Default rate – is an estimate of the likelihood of not \\ncollecting contractual amounts owed expressed as a \\nconstant default rate (CDR). \\n• Discount rate – is a rate of return used to calculate the \\npresent value of the future expected cash flow to arrive at \\nthe fair value of an instrument. The discount rate consists \\nof a benchmark rate component and a risk premium \\ncomponent. The benchmark rate component, for example, \\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or U.S. Treasury \\nrates, is generally observable within the market and is \\nnecessary to appropriately reflect the time value of money. \\nThe risk premium component reflects the amount of compensation market participants require due to the \\nuncertainty inherent in the instruments’ cash flows resulting \\nfrom risks such as credit and liquidity. \\n• Fall-out factor – is the expected percentage of loans \\nassociated with our interest rate lock commitment portfolio \\nthat are likely of not funding. \\n• Initial-value servicing – is the estimated value of the \\nunderlying loan, including the value attributable to the \\nembedded servicing right, expressed in basis points of \\noutstanding unpaid principal balance. \\n• Loss severity – is the estimated percentage of contractual \\ncash flows lost in the event of a default. \\n• Multiples – are financial ratios of comparable public \\ncompanies, such as ratios of enterprise value or market value \\nof equity to earnings before interest, depreciation, and \\namortization (EBITDA), revenue, net income or book value, \\nadjusted to reflect dissimilarities in operational, financial, or \\nmarketability to the comparable public company used in a \\nmarket valuation approach. \\n• Prepayment rate – is the estimated rate at which forecasted \\nprepayments of principal of the related loan or debt \\ninstrument are expected to occur, expressed as a constant \\nprepayment rate (CPR). \\n• Volatility factor – is the extent of change in price an item is \\nestimated to fluctuate over a specified period of time \\nexpressed as a percentage of relative change in price over a \\nperiod over time. \\n• Weighted average life – is the weighted average number of \\nyears an investment is expected to remain outstanding \\nbased on its expected cash flows reflecting the estimated \\ndate the issuer will call or extend the maturity of the \\ninstrument or otherwise reflecting an estimate of the timing \\nof an instrument’s cash flows whose timing is not \\ncontractually fixed. \\nInterrelationships and Uncertainty of Inputs Used in \\nRecurring Level 3 Fair Value Measurements \\nUsage of the valuation techniques presented in Table 15.3 \\nrequires determination of relevant inputs and assumptions, some \\nof which represent significant unobservable inputs. Accordingly, \\nchanges in these unobservable inputs may have a significant \\nimpact on fair value. \\nCertain of these unobservable inputs will (in isolation) have a \\ndirectionally consistent impact on the fair value of the \\ninstrument for a given change in that input. Alternatively, the fair \\nvalue of the instrument may move in an opposite direction for a \\ngiven change in another input. Where multiple inputs are used \\nwithin the valuation technique of an asset or liability, a change in \\none input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite \\nchange in another input having a potentially muted impact to the \\noverall fair value of that particular instrument. Additionally, a \\nchange in one unobservable input may result in a change to \\nanother unobservable input (that is, changes in certain inputs are \\ninterrelated to one another), which may counteract or magnify \\nthe fair value impact. \\nDEBT SECURITIES AND LOANS HELD FOR SALE The internal models \\nused to determine fair value for these Level 3 instruments use \\ncertain significant unobservable inputs within a discounted cash \\nflow or market comparable pricing valuation technique. Such \\ninputs include discount rate, prepayment rate, default rate, loss \\nseverity, multiples, and comparability adjustment. \\nThese Level 3 assets would decrease (increase) in value \\nbased upon an increase (decrease) in discount rate, default rate \\nor loss severity inputs and would generally decrease (increase) in Note 15:   Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities (continued) \\n152 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

An increase in any of \\nthese unobservable inputs will reduce the fair value of the MSRs \\nand alternatively, a decrease in any one of these inputs would \\nresult in the MSRs increasing in value. Generally, a decrease in \\ndiscount rates increases the value of MSRs, unless accompanied \\nby a related update to our prepayment rates. The cost to service \\nassumption generally does not increase or decrease based on \\nmovements in the discount rate or the prepayment rate. The \\nsensitivity to key assumptions of our residential MSRs is \\ndiscussed further in Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities). \\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS Level 3 derivative instruments are \\nvalued using market comparable pricing, option pricing and \\ndiscounted cash flow valuation techniques which use certain \\nunobservable inputs to determine fair value. Such inputs consist \\nof prepayment rate, default rate, loss severity, initial-value \\nservicing, fall-out factor, volatility factor, weighted average life, \\nconversion factor, and correlation factor. \\nLevel 3 derivative assets (liabilities) where we are long the \\nunderlying would decrease (increase) in value upon an increase (decrease) in default rate, fall-out factor, conversion factor, or \\nloss severity inputs. Conversely, Level 3 derivative assets \\n(liabilities) would generally increase (decrease) in value upon an \\nincrease (decrease) in prepayment rate, initial-value servicing, \\nweighted average life or volatility factor inputs. The inverse of \\nthe above relationships would occur for instruments when we are \\nshort the underlying. The correlation factor input may have a \\npositive or negative impact on the fair value of derivative \\ninstruments depending on the change in fair value of the item \\nthe correlation factor references. \\nGenerally, for derivative instruments for which we are \\nsubject to changes in the value of the underlying referenced \\ninstrument, a change in the assumption used for default rate is \\naccompanied by directionally similar change in the risk premium \\ncomponent of the discount rate (specifically, the portion related \\nto credit risk) and a directionally opposite change in the \\nassumption used for prepayment rates. Unobservable inputs for \\nloss severity, initial-value servicing, fall-out factor, volatility \\nfactor, weighted average life, conversion factor, and correlation \\nfactor do not increase or decrease based on movements in other \\nsignificant unobservable inputs for these Level 3 instruments. \\nAssets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a \\nNonrecurring Basis \\nWe may be required, from time to time, to measure certain \\nassets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with \\nGAAP.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include: \\n• underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities; \\n• providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n• entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n• holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n• acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n• providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n• providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE   In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage \\nloans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are \\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, \\nwhich provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \\nservicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \\npools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \\n(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \\nVeterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \\nGSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, \\nsponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \\nmost significant to the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \\nto repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \\nthree scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \\nunilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \\na corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to \\nthe securitization. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded \\nassets and related liabilities of $1.0 billion and $743 million, \\nrespectively, where we did not exercise our option to repurchase \\neligible loans. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 \\nand 2021, we repurchased loans of $293 million, $2.2 billion, and \\n$4.6 billion, respectively. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At December 31, 2023 and 2022, our liability for \\nthese repurchase and recourse arrangements was $229 million \\nand $167 million, respectively, and the maximum exposure to \\nloss was $13.6 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2023 and \\n2022, respectively. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS   In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \\nloans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \\nNonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest \\nholders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \\nthe securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \\nloans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \\nretain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \\ninterests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \\ninvestment purposes. Our servicing role related to \\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is \\nlimited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \\nVIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \\nor the controlling class security holder. For our residential \\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as \\nsales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider \\npotentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a \\nmajority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS   We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 16.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets, securities, and loans. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to \\nresidential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and \\ngenerally result in no gain or loss because the loans are measured \\nWells Fargo & Company 157 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES   We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement.

We exclude \\ncertain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our \\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature \\nor insignificant in size. \\nIn Table 16.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the \\nmost current information available. “Carrying value” is the \\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our \\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure \\nto loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in \\nthe VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that \\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity \\nand lending commitments, the notional amount of net written \\nderivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or \\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and \\ncertain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, \\nsold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for \\nwhich we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset \\nfrom any economic hedges.

The \\nprojects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have \\nthe power over the VIE’s assets, therefore, we do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax \\ncredit VIEs was $19.7 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively. We also had loans to tax credit VIEs \\nwith a carrying value of $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nOur maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, was $30.6 billion and \\n$28.0 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss \\nincluded total unfunded equity and lending commitments of \\n$8.7 billion and $7.3 billion at December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively. See Note 17 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) for additional information about commitments to purchase \\nequity securities. \\nOur affordable housing equity investments qualify for the \\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For these investments \\nwe are periodically required to provide additional financial \\nsupport during the investment period, or at the discretion of \\nproject sponsors. A liability is recognized for unfunded \\ncommitments that are both legally binding and probable of \\nfunding. These commitments are predominantly funded within \\nthree years of initial investment.

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $7 million and $157 million with related collateral of $27 million and $1.3 billion \\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \\nthat would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \\ncircumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in Table \\n17.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could use to \\noffset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \\nagreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \\nthe guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \\nthe credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 17.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \\ndetermined based on an external rating or an internal credit \\ngrade that is below investment grade, if applicable. \\nSTANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT We issue standby letters of credit, \\nwhich include performance and financial guarantees, for \\ncustomers in connection with contracts between our customers \\nand third parties. Standby letters of credit are conditional lending \\ncommitments where we are obligated to make payment to a \\nthird party on behalf of a customer if the customer fails to meet \\ntheir contractual obligations. Total maximum exposure to loss \\nincludes the portion of multipurpose lending facilities for which \\nwe have issued standby letters of credit under the commitments. \\nDIRECT PAY LETTERS OF CREDIT   We issue direct pay letters of \\ncredit to serve as credit enhancements for certain bond \\nissuances. Beneficiaries (bond trustees) may draw upon these \\ninstruments to make scheduled principal and interest payments, redeem all outstanding bonds because a default event has \\noccurred, or for other reasons as permitted by the agreement. \\nLOANS AND LHFS SOLD WITH RECOURSE \\xa0 For certain sales and \\nsecuritizations of loans, predominantly to GSEs, we provide \\nrecourse to the buyer for certain losses. Certain arrangements \\nrequire that we share in the credit risk of the loans, substantially \\nall of which are commercial real estate mortgage loans, where we \\nprovide recourse up to 33.33% of actual losses incurred on a pro-\\nrata basis in the event of borrower default. The maximum \\nexposure to loss represents the outstanding principal balance of \\nthe loans sold or securitized that are subject to recourse \\nprovisions or the maximum losses per the contractual \\nagreements. However, we believe the likelihood of loss of the \\nentire balance due to these recourse agreements is remote, and \\namounts paid can be recovered in whole or in part from the sale \\nof collateral. \\nEXCHANGE AND CLEARING HOUSE GUARANTEES We are members \\nof several securities and derivatives exchanges and clearing \\nhouses, both in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S., that we \\nuse to clear our trades and those of our customers, including \\ncustomers for whom we act as sponsoring member. It is common \\nthat all members in these organizations are required to \\ncollectively guarantee the performance of other members of the \\norganization. Our obligations under the guarantees are generally \\na pro-rata share based on either a fixed amount or a multiple of \\nthe guarantee fund we are required to maintain with these \\norganizations. Some membership rules require members to \\nassume a pro-rata share of losses resulting from another \\nmember’s default or from non-member default losses after \\napplying the guarantee fund.

We are required \\nto pay the counterparties to these agreements if third parties \\ndefault on certain obligations. \\nUnder certain factoring arrangements, we may be required \\nto purchase trade receivables from third parties, if receivable \\ndebtors default on their payment obligations. \\nWe use certain third-party clearing agents to clear and settle \\ntransactions on behalf of some of our institutional brokerage \\ncustomers. We indemnify the clearing agents against loss that \\ncould occur for non-performance by our customers on \\ntransactions that are not sufficiently collateralized. Transactions \\nsubject to the indemnifications may include customer obligations \\nrelated to the settlement of margin accounts and short \\npositions, such as written call options and securities borrowing \\ntransactions. \\nWe record a liability for mortgage loans that we expect to \\nrepurchase pursuant to various representations or warranties. \\nSee Note 16 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) for \\nfurther discussion and related amounts. Additionally, when we \\nsell MSRs, we may provide indemnification for losses incurred \\ndue to material breaches of contractual representations or \\nwarranties as well as other recourse arrangements. \\nWhen we sell renewable energy tax credits, we indemnify the \\nbuyers for potential future losses incurred due to the \\ndisallowance or recapture of the transferred tax credits or \\nmaterial breaches of representations and warranties. Our \\nmaximum exposure for these tax credit indemnifications is \\ncapped at the amount of the transferred credits. \\nWe also enter into other types of indemnification \\nagreements in the ordinary course of business under which we \\nagree to indemnify third parties against any damages, losses and \\nexpenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings \\narising from relationships or transactions with us. These \\nrelationships or transactions include those arising from service as \\na director or officer of the Company, underwriting agreements \\nrelating to our securities, acquisition agreements and various \\nother business transactions or arrangements. Because the extent \\nof our obligations under these agreements depends entirely \\nupon the occurrence of future events, we are unable to \\ndetermine our potential future liability under these agreements. \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency \\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \\nderivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \\nWritten put options give the counterparty the right to sell to us \\nan underlying instrument held by the counterparty at a specified \\nprice by a specified date. While these derivative transactions \\nexpose us to risk if the option is exercised, we manage this risk by \\nentering into offsetting trades or by taking short positions in the \\nunderlying instrument. We offset market risk related to options \\nwritten to customers with cash securities or other offsetting \\nderivative transactions. Additionally, for certain of these \\ncontracts, we require the counterparty to pledge the underlying \\ninstrument as collateral for the transaction. Our ultimate \\nobligation under written options is based on future market \\nconditions and is only quantifiable at settlement. The fair value of \\nwritten options represents our view of the probability that we will be required to perform under the contract. The fair value of \\nthese written options was an asset of $178 million and a liability \\nof $15 million at December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The \\nfair value may be an asset as a result of deferred premiums on \\ncertain option trades. The maximum exposure to loss represents \\nthe notional value of these derivative contracts. At December 31, \\n2023, the maximum exposure to loss was $34.0 billion, with \\n$31.9 billion expiring in three years or less compared with \\n$23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, \\n2022. See Note 14 (Derivatives) for additional information \\nregarding written derivative contracts. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES   We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks \\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \\nconnection with payment and delivery disputes between the \\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. If we are \\nunable to collect the amounts from the merchant, we incur a loss \\nfor the refund to the cardholder. We are secondarily obligated to \\nmake a refund for transactions involving sponsored merchant \\nprocessing servicers. We generally have a low likelihood of loss in \\nconnection with our merchant processing services because most \\nproducts and services are delivered when purchased and \\namounts are generally refunded when items are returned to the \\nmerchant. In addition, we may reduce our risk in connection with \\nthese transactions by withholding future payments and requiring \\ncash or other collateral. We estimate our potential maximum \\nexposure to be the total merchant transaction volume processed \\nin the preceding four months, which is generally the lifecycle for a \\ncharge-back transaction. As of December 31, 2023, our potential \\nmaximum exposure was approximately $761.9 billion, and \\nrelated losses, including those from our joint venture entity, were \\ninsignificant. \\nGUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES   In the normal course of business, \\nthe Parent may provide counterparties with guarantees related \\nto its subsidiaries’ obligations. These obligations are included in \\nthe Company’s consolidated balance sheet or are reflected as \\noff-balance sheet commitments, and therefore, the Parent has \\nnot recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. \\nAdditionally, the Parent fully and unconditionally guarantees \\nthe payment of principal, interest, and any other amounts that \\nmay be due on securities that its 100% owned finance subsidiary, \\nWells Fargo Finance LLC, may issue. These securities are not \\nguaranteed by any other subsidiary of the Parent. The \\nguaranteed liabilities were $834 million and $948 million at \\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These guarantees \\nrank on parity with all of the Parent’s other unsecured and \\nunsubordinated indebtedness. \\nThe assets of the Parent consist primarily of equity in its \\nsubsidiaries, and the Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity \\nfrom its subsidiaries. As a result, the Parent’s ability to address \\nclaims of holders of these debt securities against the Parent \\nunder the guarantee depends on the Parent’s receipt of \\ndividends, loan payments and other funds from its subsidiaries. If \\nany of the Parent’s subsidiaries becomes insolvent, the direct \\ncreditors of that subsidiary will have a prior claim on that \\nsubsidiary’s assets. The rights of the Parent and the rights of the \\nParent’s creditors will be subject to that prior claim unless the \\nParent is also a direct creditor of that subsidiary.

These activities are \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \\nactivities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \\nU.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \\nsecurities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements \\ninvolving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \\nour commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES   Table 18.1 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \\nmaster securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. Collateralized financings with the same \\ncounterparty are presented net on our consolidated balance \\nsheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit balance sheet \\nnetting. The majority of transactions subject to these \\nagreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not eligible \\nfor balance sheet netting. \\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \\nsuch as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet against the related liability. Collateral we received \\nincludes securities or loans and is not recognized on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet. Collateral pledged or received may \\nbe increased or decreased over time to maintain certain \\ncontractual thresholds, as the assets underlying each \\narrangement fluctuate in value. For additional information on \\ncollateral pledged and accepted, see Note 19 (Pledged Assets \\nand Collateral). Generally, these agreements require collateral to \\nexceed the asset or liability recognized on the balance sheet. The \\nfollowing table includes the amount of collateral pledged or \\nreceived related to exposures subject to enforceable MRAs or \\nMSLAs. While these agreements are typically over-collateralized, \\nthe disclosure in this table is limited to the reported amount of \\nsuch collateral to the amount of the related recognized asset or \\nliability for each counterparty. \\nIn addition to the amounts included in Table 18.1, we also \\nhave balance sheet netting related to derivatives that is disclosed \\nin Note 14 (Derivatives). \\nTable 18.1:   Offsetting – Securities and Other Collateralized Financing Activities \\n(in millions) Dec 31, \\n2023 Dec 31, \\n2022 \\nAssets: \\nResale and securities borrowing agreements \\nGross amounts recognized $ 129,282 114,729 \\nGross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) (28,402) (24,464) \\nNet amounts in consolidated balance sheet (2) 100,880 90,265 \\nCollateral received not recognized in consolidated balance sheet (3) (99,970) (89,592) \\nNet amount (4) $ 910 673 \\nLiabilities: Repurchase and securities lending agreements \\nGross amounts recognized $ 106,060 55,054 \\nGross amounts offset in consolidated balance sheet (1) (28,402) (24,464) \\nNet amounts in consolidated balance sheet (5) 77,658 30,590 \\nCollateral pledged but not netted in consolidated balance sheet (6) (77,529) (30,383) \\nNet amount (4) $ 129 207 \\n(1) Represents recognized amount of resale and repurchase agreements with counterparties subject to enforceable MRAs that have been offset within our consolidated balance sheet. \\n(2) Includes $80.4 billion and $68.0 billion classified on our consolidated balance sheet in federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements at December 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively.

The management reporting process measures \\nthe performance of the reportable operating segments based on \\nthe Company’s management structure, and the results are \\nregularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant \\nsenior management. The management reporting process is \\nbased on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as \\nfunds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared \\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial \\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with \\nannual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products \\nand services include checking and savings accounts, credit and \\ndebit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business \\nlending. \\nCommercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, \\nfamily owned and certain public companies.

Our obligation for event-driven services is \\nsatisfied at the time of the event when the service is delivered, \\nwhile our obligation for maintenance services is satisfied over the \\ncourse of each month. Our obligation for overdraft services is \\nsatisfied at the time of the overdraft.

Trailing \\ncommissions are earned for selling shares to investors and our \\nobligation is satisfied at the time shares are sold. However, these \\nfees are received and recognized over time during the period the \\ncustomer owns the shares and we remain the broker of record. \\nThe amount of trailing commissions is variable based on the \\nlength of time the customer holds the shares and on changes in \\nthe value of the underlying assets. \\nAsset management services include managing and \\nadministering assets, including mutual funds, and institutional \\nseparate accounts. Fees for these services are generally \\ndetermined based on a tiered scale relative to the market value \\nof assets under management (AUM).

Substantially all \\nof the restructuring charges were personnel expenses related to \\nseverance costs associated with headcount reductions with \\npayments made over time in accordance with our severance plan \\nas well as payments for other employee benefit costs such as \\nincentive compensation. \\nRestructuring charges are recorded as a component of other \\nnoninterest expense on our consolidated statement of income. \\nChanges in estimates represent adjustments to noninterest \\nexpense based on refinements to previously estimated amounts, \\nwhich may reflect trends such as higher voluntary employee \\nattrition as well as changes in business activities. \\nTable 21.3 provides details on our restructuring charges. \\nTable 21.3:   Accruals for Restructuring Charges \\nYear ended December 31, \\n(in millions) 2023 2022 2021 \\nBalance, beginning of period $ 166 565 1,214 \\nRestructuring charges: \\nCurrent period restructuring charges — — 726 \\nChanges in estimates — 5 (650) \\nTotal restructuring charges — 5 76 \\nPayments and utilization (166) (404) (725) \\nBalance, end of period $ — 166 565 \\nOTHER EXPENSES   Regulatory Charges and Assessments expense, \\nwhich is included in other noninterest expense, was $3.1 billion, \\n$860 million, and $842 million in 2023, 2022 and 2021 \\nrespectively, and predominantly consisted of Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment expense. \\nIn November 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule to recover \\nlosses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank \\nfailures in the first half of 2023. Under the rule, the FDIC will \\ncollect a special assessment based on a calculation using an \\ninsured depository institution’s (IDI) estimated amount of \\nuninsured deposits. Upon the FDIC’s finalization of the rule, we \\nexpensed the entire estimated amount of our special assessment \\nof $1.9 billion (pre-tax), which will be paid over eight quarters \\nbeginning in June 2024.

The Cash Balance Plan was frozen on July 1, 2009, \\nand no new benefits accrue after that date. \\nPrior to July 1, 2009, eligible employees’ Cash Balance Plan \\naccounts were allocated a compensation credit based on a \\npercentage of their certified compensation; the freeze \\ndiscontinued the allocation of compensation credits after \\nJune 30, 2009.

For the \\nnonqualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans, \\nthere is no minimum required contribution beyond the amount \\nneeded to fund benefit payments. \\nWe recognize settlement losses for our Cash Balance Plan \\nbased on an assessment of whether lump sum benefit payments \\nwill, in aggregate for the year, exceed the sum of its annual \\nservice and interest cost (threshold). Settlement losses of \\n$221 million were recognized during 2022, representing the pro \\nrata portion of the net loss in accumulated other comprehensive \\nincome (AOCI) based on the percentage reduction in the Cash \\nBalance Plan’s projected benefit obligation attributable to 2022 lump sum payments (included in the “Benefits paid” line in Table \\n22.1). There were no settlement losses recognized during 2023. \\nAdditionally, we sponsored the Wells Fargo Canada \\nCorporation Pension Plan to employees in Canada (Canada \\nPension Plan), a defined benefit retirement plan. In June 2022, an \\nannuity contract was entered into that effected a full settlement \\nof this Canada Pension Plan, resulting in a plan settlement of \\n$29 million and a settlement loss of $5 million. \\nOur nonqualified defined benefit plans are unfunded and \\nprovide supplemental defined benefit pension benefits to certain \\neligible employees.

This rate is \\nassumed to trend down 0.30%-3.20% per year until the trend \\nrate reaches an ultimate rate of 4.50% in 2033.

This rate was assumed to decrease 0.60%-1.50% \\nper year until the trend rate reached an ultimate rate of 4.50% in \\n2032. \\nInvestment Strategy and Asset Allocation \\nWe seek to achieve the expected long-term rate of return with a \\nprudent level of risk, given the benefit obligations of the pension \\nplans and their funded status. Our overall investment strategy is \\ndesigned to provide our Cash Balance Plan with a moderate \\namount of long-term growth opportunities while ensuring that \\nrisk is mitigated through diversification across numerous asset \\nclasses and various investment strategies, coupled with an \\ninvestment strategy for the fixed income assets that is generally \\ndesigned to match the interest rate sensitivity of the Cash \\nBalance Plan’s benefit obligations. The Cash Balance Plan \\ncurrently has a target asset allocation mix of the following \\nranges: 75%-85% fixed income, 10%-20% equities, and 0%-10% \\nin real estate, private equity and other investments. The \\nEmployee Benefit Review Committee (EBRC), which includes \\nseveral members of senior management, formally reviews the \\ninvestment risk and performance of our Cash Balance Plan on a \\nquarterly basis. Annual Plan liability analysis and periodic asset/ \\nliability evaluations are also conducted. Other benefit plan assets include (1) assets held in a 401(h) \\ntrust, which are invested with a target mix of 50%-60% equities \\nand 40%-50% fixed income, and (2) assets held in the Retiree \\nMedical Plan Voluntary Employees’ Beneficiary Association \\n(VEBA) trust, which are primarily invested in fixed income \\nsecurities and cash.

The NAV per share is \\nquoted on a private market that is not active; however, the NAV \\nper share is based on underlying investments traded on an active \\nmarket. This group of assets also includes investments in \\nregistered investment companies valued at the NAV per share \\nheld at year end and in interest-bearing bank accounts. \\nLong Duration, Intermediate (Core), High-Yield, and \\nInternational Fixed Income – includes investments traded on the \\nsecondary markets; prices are measured by using quoted market \\nprices for similar securities, pricing models, and discounted cash \\nflow analyses using significant inputs observable in the market \\nwhere available, or a combination of multiple valuation \\ntechniques. This group of assets also includes highly liquid \\ngovernment securities such as U.S. Treasuries, limited \\npartnerships valued at the NAV, registered investment \\ncompanies, and collective investment funds described above. \\nDomestic, Global, International and Emerging Market Stocks – \\ninvestments in exchange-traded equity securities are valued at \\nquoted market values. This group of assets also includes \\ninvestments in registered investment companies and collective \\ninvestment funds described above. \\nReal Estate –includes investments in exchange-traded equity \\nsecurities, and registered investment companies described \\nabove. \\nHedge Funds / Absolute Return – includes investments in \\ncollective investment funds as described above. \\nOther – insurance contracts that are stated at cash surrender \\nvalue. This group of assets also includes investments in \\nregistered investment companies and collective investment \\nfunds described above. \\nThe methods described above may produce a fair value \\ncalculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or \\nreflective of future fair values. While we believe our valuation \\nmethods are appropriate and consistent with other market \\nparticipants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions \\nto determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could \\nresult in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans \\nWe sponsor a qualified defined contribution retirement plan, the \\nWells Fargo & Company 401(k) Plan (401(k) Plan). Under the \\n401(k) Plan, after 1 month of service, eligible employees may \\ncontribute up to 50% of their certified compensation, subject to \\nstatutory limits. \\nWith some exceptions, employees with one year of service \\nwho are employed in a benefit-eligible position on December 15 \\nare eligible to receive matching contributions, which are dollar for \\ndollar up to 6% of certified compensation.

Our responsibility is to express an \\nopinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and \\nare required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules \\nand regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \\nobtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, \\non a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included \\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation \\nof the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. \\nCritical Audit Matters \\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial \\nstatements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or \\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex \\njudgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, \\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit \\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. \\nAssessment of the allowance for credit losses for loans (ACL) \\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s ACL as of December 31, 2023 was \\n$15.1 billion. The ACL includes the measurement of expected credit losses on a collective basis for those loans that share similar risk \\ncharacteristics and on an individual basis for those loans that do not share similar risk characteristics. The Company estimated the \\nACL for collectively evaluated commercial loans by applying probability of default and severity of loss estimates to an expected \\nexposure at default. The probability of default and severity of loss estimates are statistically derived utilizing credit loss models \\nbased on historical observations of default and losses after default for each credit risk rating. The Company estimated the ACL for \\ncollectively evaluated consumer loans utilizing credit loss models which estimate expected credit losses in the portfolio based on \\nhistorical experience of probability of default and severity of loss estimates. The Company’s credit loss models utilize economic \\nvariables, including economic assumptions forecast over a reasonable and supportable forecast period. The Company forecasts \\nmultiple economic scenarios and applies weighting to the scenarios that are used to estimate expected credit losses. After the \\nreasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company reverts over the reversion period to the long-term average for the \\nforecasted economic variables based on historical observations over multiple economic cycles. The Company estimated the ACL for \\nindividually evaluated commercial loans using discounted cash flow (DCF) or fair value of collateral methods. A portion of the ACL is \\ncomprised of adjustments for qualitative factors which may not be adequately captured in the loss models. \\nWe identified the assessment of the ACL as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and \\nknowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the ACL. Specifically, the assessment \\nencompassed the evaluation of the ACL methodology for collectively evaluated loans, including the methods and models used to \\nestimate (1) probability of default and severity of loss estimates, significant economic assumptions, the reasonable and supportable \\nforecast period, the historical observation period, and credit risk ratings for commercial loans, and (2) the adjustments for \\nqualitative factors that may not be adequately captured in the loss models.

The Company recognizes MSRs when it \\nretains servicing rights in connection with the sale or securitization of loans it originated or purchases servicing rights from third \\nparties and has elected to carry its residential MSRs at fair value with periodic changes reflected in earnings. The Company uses a \\nvaluation model for determining fair value that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income cash flows, \\nwhich incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income cash flows. These \\nassumptions include estimates of prepayment rates (including estimated borrower defaults), discount rates, cost to service \\n(including delinquency and foreclosure costs), escrow account earnings, contractual servicing fee income, ancillary income and late \\nfees. The estimated fair value of MSRs is periodically benchmarked to independent appraisals. \\nWe identified the assessment of the valuation of residential MSRs as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including \\nspecialized skills and knowledge, and subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment of the MSRs. \\nSpecifically, there was a high degree of subjectivity used to evaluate the valuation model and the following assumptions because \\nthey are unobservable and the sensitivity of changes to those assumptions had a significant effect on the valuation (1) prepayment \\nrates, (2) discount rates, and (3) cost to service. There was also a high degree of subjectivity and potential for management bias \\nrelated to updates made to significant assumptions due to changes in market conditions, mortgage interest rates, or servicing \\nstandards. \\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested \\nthe operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the assessment of residential MSRs, including controls over the: \\n• assessment of the valuation model \\n• evaluation of the significant assumptions (prepayment rates, discount rates, and cost to service) used in determining the MSR \\nfair value \\n• comparison of the MSR fair value to independent appraisals. \\nWe evaluated the Company’s process to develop the MSR fair value by testing certain sources of data and assumptions that the \\nCompany used and considered the relevance and reliability of such data and assumptions. In addition, we involved valuation \\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in: \\n• evaluating the design of the valuation model used to estimate the MSR fair value in accordance with relevant U.S. generally \\naccepted accounting principles \\n• evaluating significant assumptions based on an analysis of backtesting results and a comparison of significant assumptions to \\navailable data for comparable entities and independent appraisals \\n• assessing significant assumption updates made during the year by considering backtesting results, market events, independent \\nappraisals, and other circumstances that a market participant would have expected to be incorporated in the valuation that \\nwere not incorporated. \\nAssessment of goodwill impairment \\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s goodwill balance as of December 31, 2023 \\nwas $25.2 billion. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or \\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired, by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its \\ncarrying amount, including goodwill. Management estimates the fair value of its reporting units using both an income approach and \\na market approach. The income approach is a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis that incorporates assumptions including financial \\nforecasts, a terminal value based on an assumed long-term growth rate, and a discount rate. The financial forecasts include future \\nexpectations of economic conditions and balance sheet changes, and considerations related to future business activities. The \\nforecasted cash flows are discounted using a rate derived from a capital asset pricing model which produces an estimated cost of \\nequity to the reporting unit. The market approach utilizes observable market data from comparable publicly traded companies and \\nincorporates assumptions including the selection of comparable companies and a control premium representative of management’s \\nexpectation of a hypothetical acquisition of the reporting unit. \\nWe identified the assessment of goodwill impairment for the Consumer Lending reporting unit, which had $7.1 billion of allocated \\ngoodwill as of December 31, 2023, as a critical audit matter. A high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, \\nand subjective and complex auditor judgment was involved in the assessment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the \\nevaluation of certain assumptions used in the DCF analysis to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, including (1) the future \\nexpectations of balance sheet changes and business activities used in the financial forecast and (2) the discount rate. \\n190 Wells Fargo & Company ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Contracts . We adopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and \\ncertain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the \\nCompany’s ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. \\n(3) Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and interest-earning deposits with banks. \\n(4) Book value per common share is common stockholders’ equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares \\noutstanding. \\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than \\nmortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible \\ncommon equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common \\nequity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company’s use of equity.

Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s 2023 \\nrankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among \\nall U.S. banks at June 30, 2023. \\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business, \\noperations, products and services, and risk management \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience \\nissues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. \\nWe are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we \\nimplement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result \\nin additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others, and \\nregulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues. \\nFailure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a \\ntimely basis could result in additional penalties, business \\nrestrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, \\nincreased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, \\nand other negative consequences, which could be significant. \\nWhile we still have significant work to do and have not yet \\nsatisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the \\nCompany is committed to devoting the resources necessary to \\noperate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the \\nhighest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in \\nplace. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017.

As required by the consent orders, the \\nCompany submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide \\ncompliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the \\nCompany’s internal audit program with respect to federal \\nconsumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In \\naddition, as required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers \\naffected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and \\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the \\nmanagement of remediation activities conducted by the \\nCompany. The Company continues to work to address the \\nprovisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the \\nOCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the \\nCompany related to insufficient progress in addressing \\nrequirements under the OCC’s April 2018 consent order and loss \\nmitigation activities in the Company’s Home Lending business. \\nOn December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to \\nclarify how it would terminate. \\nWells Fargo & Company 3 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In addition, the consent \\norder restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nresidential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \\nmortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \\nCompany’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \\nprovided. \\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \\nLending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \\nLending \\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \\norder with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \\nremediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \\nconsumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \\npractices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \\nrefunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \\nprotection agreements; comply with certain business practice \\nrequirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \\n$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk \\nFactors” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our \\nongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our \\nrisk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the \\nfuture identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To \\nthe extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any \\ncustomer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have \\npreviously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding these activities, \\nincluding related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” \\nsection in our 2022 Form 10-K. Recent Developments \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \\nIn May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \\nproposed a rule to recover by special assessment losses to the \\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of recent bank failures. \\nUnder the proposed rule, the FDIC would collect a special \\nassessment based on a calculation using an insured depository \\ninstitution’s estimated amount of uninsured deposits. As \\ncurrently proposed, the amount of our special assessment may \\nbe up to $1.8 billion (pre-tax), and we expect to expense the \\nentire amount upon the FDIC’s finalization of the rule. The \\nproposed rule may be changed prior to finalization and any \\nchanges may affect the timing or amount of the special \\nassessment. \\nLIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a widely \\nreferenced benchmark rate that sought to estimate the cost at \\nwhich banks could borrow on an unsecured basis from other \\nbanks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial \\nConduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the \\nadministrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of \\nLIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis \\nafter December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. \\ndollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a \\nrepresentative basis after June 30, 2023. \\nIn first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \\nAct (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide \\na statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate \\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in U.S. \\nlaw contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have \\nfallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on \\nLIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act \\non December 16, 2022, which became effective on February 27, \\n2023. \\nWe no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR and \\nlegacy contracts indexed to USD LIBOR have transitioned to \\nSOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance \\nwith existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. \\nFor additional information regarding the risks and potential \\nimpact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being \\nsignificantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the “Risk \\nFactors” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCapital Matters \\nIn June 2023, the Company completed the annual \\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test \\nprocess. On July 27, 2023, the FRB confirmed that our stress \\ncapital buffer for the period October 1, 2023, through \\nSeptember 30, 2024, will be 2.90%, which is lower than our \\ncurrent stress capital buffer of 3.20%. \\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany's third quarter 2023 common stock dividend to $0.35 \\nper share and the Company announced that the Board authorized \\na new common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025.

Net income increased in \\nsecond quarter 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, \\npredominantly due to a $3.0 billion increase in net interest \\nincome, partially offset by a $1.1 billion increase in provision for \\ncredit losses. \\nNet income for the first half of 2023 was $9.9 billion \\n($2.48 diluted EPS), compared with $6.9 billion ($1.66 diluted \\nEPS) in the same period a year ago. Net income increased in the \\nfirst half of 2023, compared with the same period a year ago, \\npredominantly due to a $7.1 billion increase in net interest \\nincome, partially offset by a $3.1 billion increase in provision for \\ncredit losses and a $586 million decrease in noninterest income. Net Interest Income \\nNet interest income and net interest margin increased in both \\nthe second quarter and first half of 2023, compared with the \\nsame periods a year ago, due to the impact of higher interest \\nrates on earning assets and higher loan balances, partially offset \\nby higher expenses for interest bearing deposits and long-term \\ndebt . \\nTable 1 presents the individual components of net interest \\nincome and net interest margin. Net interest income and net \\ninterest margin are presented on a taxable-equivalent basis in \\nTable 1 to consistently reflect income from taxable and tax-\\nexempt loans and debt and equity securities based on a 21% \\nfederal statutory tax rate for the periods ended June 30, 2023 \\nand 2022. \\nFor additional information about net interest income and \\nnet interest margin, see the “Earnings Performance – Net \\nInterest Income” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nWells Fargo & Company 6 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5. We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nTable 5: Management Reporting Structure When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January 1, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment’s use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\noperating segments or lines of business. \\nWells Fargo & Company \\nConsumer \\nBanking and\\nLending Commercial \\nBanking Corporate and\\nInvestment \\nBanking Wealth and \\nInvestment \\nManagement Corporate \\n• Consumer and \\nSmall Business \\nBanking \\n• Home Lending \\n• Credit Card \\n• Auto \\n• Personal Lending • Middle Market \\nBanking \\n• Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing • Banking \\n• Commercial Real \\nEstate \\n• Markets • Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors \\n• The Private \\nBank • Corporate \\nTreasury \\n• Enterprise \\nFunctions \\n• Investment \\nPortfolio \\n• Affiliated venture \\ncapital and private \\nequity businesses \\n• Non-strategic \\nbusinesses \\nWells Fargo & Company 12 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our off-balance sheet arrangements \\ninclude unfunded credit commitments, transactions with \\nunconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. \\nThese transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs \\nof customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, \\nand/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nUnfunded Credit Commitments \\nUnfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to \\nlend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, \\ncontractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required \\ncollateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these \\ncommitments may expire without being used or may be \\ncancelled at the customer’s request. Our credit risk monitoring \\nactivities include managing the amount of commitments, both to \\nindividual customers and in total, and the size and maturity \\nstructure of these commitments. For additional information, see \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of \\non- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose \\nentities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability \\ncompanies or partnerships that are established for a limited \\npurpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with \\nsecuritization transactions and are considered variable interest \\nentities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make \\npayments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in \\nan underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are \\ngenerally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, \\nwritten options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing \\nhouse guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar \\narrangements. For additional information, see Note 14 \\n(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \\nin this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale \\nagreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities to provide capital for customers’ \\nfunding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional \\ninformation, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \\nassist customers with their risk management objectives. \\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at \\nfair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional \\namount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the \\nbasis on which interest and other payments are determined. The \\nnotional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance \\nsheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure \\nof the risk profile of the instruments.

The \\ndiscussion that follows supplements our discussion of the \\nmanagement of certain risks contained in the “Risk \\nManagement” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCredit Risk Management \\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a \\nborrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in \\naccordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many \\nof the Company’s assets and exposures such as debt security \\nholdings, certain derivatives, and loans. \\nThe Board’s Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk \\nCommittee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of \\ncredit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, \\nwhich is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the \\nChief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit \\nrisk provided to the Board’s Risk Committee or its Credit \\nSubcommittee. \\nLoan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest \\ncomponent of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which \\nwe have credit risk.

We employ various credit risk management and \\nmonitoring activities to mitigate risks associated with multiple \\nrisk factors affecting loans we hold including: \\n• Loan concentrations and related credit quality; \\n• Counterparty credit risk; \\n• Economic and market conditions; \\n• Legislative or regulatory mandates; \\n• Changes in interest rates; \\n• Merger and acquisition activities; and \\n• Reputation risk. In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate \\nconsiderations into its credit risk management activities. \\nOur credit risk management oversight process is governed \\ncentrally, but provides for direct management and accountability \\nby our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes \\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, \\nfrequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive \\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit \\nprocess. \\nA key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-\\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate \\nfor the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase \\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the loans. \\nCredit Quality Overview Table 11 provides credit quality trends . \\nTable 11: Credit Quality Overview \\n($ in millions) Jun 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nNonaccrual loans \\nCommercial loans $ 3,429 1,823 \\nConsumer loans 3,457 3,803 \\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 6,886 5,626 \\nNonaccrual loans as a % of total loans 0.73 % 0.59 \\nAllowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans $ 14,786 13,609 \\nACL for loans as a % of total loans 1.56 % 1.42 \\nQuarter ended June 30, \\n2023 2022 \\nNet loan charge-offs as a % of: \\nAverage commercial loans 0.15% 0.02 \\nAverage consumer loans 0.58 0.33 \\nSix months ended June 30, \\n2023 2022 \\nAverage commercial loans 0.10% — \\nAverage consumer loans 0.57 0.34 \\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios and our credit \\nquality trends follows. \\nSignificant Loan Portfolio Reviews Our credit risk monitoring \\nprocess is designed to enable early identification of developing \\nrisk and to support our determination of an appropriate \\nallowance for credit losses.

The \\ntotal CRE loan portfolio decreased $1.5 billion from \\nDecember 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and \\nadvances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by \\nproperty type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE \\nloans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which \\nrepresented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The \\nlargest property type concentrations are apartments at 26% and \\noffice at 21% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments \\nwere $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion at June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and \\n$16.6 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, for CRE construction \\nloans. \\nWe generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment \\nusing our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had \\nTable 13: CRE Loans by State and Property Type $14.9 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at \\nJune 30, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at December 31, \\n2022, and $1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as \\ncriticized at both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The \\nincrease in criticized CRE loans was primarily driven by the office \\nproperty type. The credit quality of the office property type \\ncontinued to be adversely affected as weakened demand for \\noffice space continued to drive higher vacancy rates and \\ndeteriorating operating performance. We continue to closely \\nmonitor this portfolio. At June 30, 2023, nearly one-third of the \\nCRE loans in the office property type had recourse to a \\nguarantor, typically through a repayment guarantee, in addition \\nto the related collateral. Loans in California and New York \\nrepresented approximately 40% of the office property type at \\nJune 30, 2023. \\nTable 13 provides our CRE loans by state and property type. \\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 \\nReal estate mortgage Real estate construction Total commercial real estate Total commercial real estate \\nLoans \\nLoans Loans Loans as % of Total Loans Total \\nNonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding total commitments outstanding commitments \\n($ in millions) loans balance loans balance loans balance loans (1) balance (1) \\nBy state: \\nCalifornia $ 740 28,465 1 4,300 741 32,765 3% $ 37,556 34,285 39,594 \\nNew York 319 14,121 — 2,476 319 16,597 2 18,358 17,294 19,360 \\nTexas 20 11,509 — 1,393 20 12,902 1 14,815 12,807 14,941 \\nFlorida 65 9,714 — 2,091 65 11,805 1 14,417 11,418 14,690 \\nGeorgia 90 4,862 — 932 90 5,794 * 7,288 5,428 6,651 \\nWashington 349 4,218 — 1,520 349 5,738 * 6,753 5,603 6,868 \\nNorth Carolina 4 4,302 — 1,179 4 5,481 * 6,700 5,227 6,650 \\nArizona 16 4,600 — 601 16 5,201 * 6,107 5,302 6,288 \\nNew Jersey 6 2,745 — 1,490 6 4,235 * 5,346 4,119 5,660 \\nMassachusetts 4 2,763 41 1,311 45 4,074 * 5,187 4,094 5,324 \\nOther (2) 851 42,256 1 7,428 852 49,684 5 57,097 50,225 59,294 \\nTotal $ 2,464 129,555 43 24,721 2,507 154,276 16% $ 179,624 155,802 185,320 \\nBy property: \\nApartments $ 9 30,513 — 10,239 9 40,752 4% $ 50,699 39,743 51,567 \\nOffice (3) 1,517 29,437 — 3,652 1,517 33,089 3 36,757 36,144 40,827 \\nIndustrial/warehouse 38 19,654 — 4,246 38 23,900 3 27,802 20,634 24,546 \\nHotel/motel 149 11,911 — 1,012 149 12,923 1 13,910 12,751 13,758 \\nRetail (excl shopping center) 355 11,301 2 111 357 11,412 1 12,334 11,753 12,486 \\nShopping center 193 8,848 — 401 193 9,249 * 9,816 9,534 10,131 \\nInstitutional 118 4,160 — 1,939 118 6,099 * 6,906 7,725 9,178 \\nMixed use properties 72 4,440 41 903 113 5,343 * 6,330 5,887 7,139 \\nCollateral pool — 2,987 — 44 — 3,031 * 3,410 3,062 3,662 \\nStorage facility — 2,819 — 164 — 2,983 * 3,299 2,929 3,201 \\nOther 13 3,485 — 2,010 13 5,495 * 8,361 5,640 8,825 \\nTotal $ 2,464 129,555 43 24,721 2,507 154,276 16 % $ 179,624 155,802 185,320 \\n* Less than 1%. \\n(1) Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit.

We establish exposure \\nlimits for each country through a centralized oversight process \\nbased on customer needs, and through consideration of the \\nrelevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures \\nclosely and adjust our country limits in response to changing \\nconditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure \\nbased on our assessment of a borrower’s ability to repay, \\nwhich gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as \\nguarantees and collateral, and may be different from the \\nreporting based on a borrower’s primary address. \\nOur largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at \\nJune 30, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled \\nTable 14: Select Country Exposures $28.6 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and \\nincluded $3.2 billion of sovereign claims.

With respect to \\nTable 14: \\n• Lending and deposits exposure includes outstanding loans, \\nunfunded credit commitments (excluding discretionary \\namounts where our approval or consent is required prior to \\nany loan funding or commitment increase), and deposits \\nwith non-U.S. banks. These balances are presented prior to \\nthe deduction of allowance for credit losses or collateral \\nreceived under the terms of the credit agreements, if any. \\n• Securities exposure represents debt and equity securities of \\nnon-U.S. issuers. Long and short positions are netted, and \\nnet short positions are reflected as negative exposure. \\n• Derivatives and other exposure represents foreign exchange \\ncontracts, derivative contracts, securities resale agreements, \\nand securities lending agreements. \\nJune 30, 2023 \\nLending and deposits Securities Derivatives and other Total exposure \\nNon- Non- Non- Non-\\n($ in millions) Sovereign sovereign Sovereign sovereign Sovereign sovereign Sovereign sovereign (1) Total \\nTop 20 country exposures: \\nUnited Kingdom $ 3,184 23,434 — 599 — 1,372 3,184 25,405 28,589 \\nCanada 9 16,658 382 447 96 175 487 17,280 17,767 \\nCayman Islands — 8,089 — — — 336 — 8,425 8,425 \\nJapan 6,058 737 — 383 — 178 6,058 1,298 7,356 \\nLuxembourg — 6,608 — (1) — 281 — 6,888 6,888 \\nFrance 107 3,893 540 239 644 61 1,291 4,193 5,484 \\nIreland 6 4,733 — 141 — 233 6 5,107 5,113 \\nBermuda — 3,407 — 34 — 57 — 3,498 3,498 \\nGermany — 3,000 — 19 — 242 — 3,261 3,261 \\nGuernsey — 3,078 — — — 9 — 3,087 3,087 \\nNetherlands — 2,644 — 146 — 102 — 2,892 2,892 \\nSouth Korea — 1,989 3 336 1 2 4 2,327 2,331 \\nAustralia — 1,669 — 254 — 16 — 1,939 1,939 \\nChile — 1,639 — 242 — 1 — 1,882 1,882 \\nChina 12 1,221 (23) 323 25 35 14 1,579 1,593 \\nBrazil — 1,415 — (7) — 3 — 1,411 1,411 \\nSwitzerland — 1,155 — (12) — 145 — 1,288 1,288 \\nBelgium — 1,057 — (4) — 1 — 1,054 1,054 \\nNorway — 776 — 220 1 22 1 1,018 1,019 \\nSpain — 643 — 144 — 172 — 959 959 \\nTotal top 20 country exposures $ 9,376 87,845 902 3,503 767 3,443 11,045 94,791 105,836 \\n(1) Total non-sovereign exposure comprised $45.6 billion exposure to financial institutions and $49.2 billion to non-financial corporations at June 30, 2023. \\nRESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS Our residential mortgage loan ARM loans were 7% of total loans at both June 30, 2023, and \\nportfolio is comprised of 1–4 family first and junior lien mortgage December 31, 2022, with an initial reset date in 2025 or later for \\nloans.

Additionally, we maintain an ACL for debt \\nsecurities classified as either AFS or HTM, other financial assets \\nmeasured at amortized cost, including deposits with banks, net \\ninvestments in leases, and other off-balance sheet credit \\nexposures. The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into \\nconsideration many factors, including historical and forecasted \\nloss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-\\nspecific characteristics. The process involves subjective and \\ncomplex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit \\nmetrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do \\nnot solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use \\nseveral analytical tools.

The entire allowance \\nis available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. \\nThe ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing \\nfactors as of the date of determination, including economic or \\nmarket conditions and ongoing internal and external examination \\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes \\nin the economic and business environment, it is possible that we \\nwill incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the \\nbalance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is \\ndiscussed in the “Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for \\nCredit Losses” section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with \\nour sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we \\nhave established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information \\non our repurchase liability, see the “Risk Management – Credit \\nRisk Management – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \\nmortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage \\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of \\nFHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label \\nmortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans \\nowned by institutional investors. \\nAs a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent \\npayments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. \\nThe amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of \\ndelinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable \\nservicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer \\nadvances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans \\nfrom GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes \\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid \\nby the borrower. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as \\na result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \\nRepurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise \\nmodified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may \\nbe included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At June 30, \\n2023, and December 31, 2022, these loans, which we have \\nrepurchased or have the option to repurchase, were $8.5 billion \\nand $9.8 billion, respectively, which included $7.8 billion and \\n$8.6 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the \\nremainder in loans held for sale. See Note 13 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information about our involvement with mortgage \\nloan securitizations. \\nFor additional information about the risks related to our \\nservicing activities, see the “Risk Management – Credit Risk \\nManagement – Mortgage Banking Activities” section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking \\nactivities, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Asset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and \\nmanaging interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For \\ninformation on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk \\nManagement – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \\ncan cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows \\nprimarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending \\nand deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: \\n• assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest \\nrates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n• assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by \\ndifferent amounts; \\n• short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nby different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield \\ncurve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs \\ndifferently; \\n• the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if \\nlong-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, \\nmortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate \\nthan anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n• interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan \\ndemand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage \\norigination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other \\nfinancial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the \\ndegree of change over time, the speed of change and the \\nprojected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require \\nassumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet \\ncomposition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans \\nand debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing \\nstrategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months \\nusing instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both \\nlower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. \\nSteeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in \\nthe yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors \\nthree years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as \\nall tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar \\ninterest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the \\nsimulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24: \\n• Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to \\nour assets and liabilities. \\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n• Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates. \\nWells Fargo & Company 39 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Deposit \\nmix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the \\nalternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, \\ncustomer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher \\nyielding products could impact expected net interest \\nincome. \\n• The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the \\nhistorical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the \\nexpectations of deposit products repricing as market \\ninterest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our \\nactual experience in base and alternative scenarios may \\ndiffer from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of \\ndeposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other \\nfactors. \\n• We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities \\nportfolios constant across scenarios. \\nTable 24: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \\nUsing Instantaneous Movements \\n($ in billions) Jun 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nParallel shift: \\n+100 bps shift in interest rates $ 1.8 2.3 \\n-100 bps shift in interest rates (2.1) (1.7) \\nSteeper yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 1.0 0.8 \\n-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.1) (1.0) \\nFlatter yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates 0.8 1.5 \\n-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (1.0) (0.7) \\nThe changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember 31, 2022, to June 30, 2023, in Table 24 reflected \\nupdates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance \\nsheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate \\nsensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher \\ninterest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater \\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest \\nrates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree \\nthan our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive \\nnoninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage \\nbanking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in \\nthe opposite direction of our net interest income. See the “Risk \\nManagement – Asset/Liability Management – Mortgage Banking \\nInterest Rate and Market Risk” section in our 2022 Form 10-K \\nfor additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\non commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \\ninformation on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage \\nour interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers \\nthe amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes \\nunrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt \\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized \\ninto earnings over the life of the security with no further impact \\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We \\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in the following \\nmain ways: \\n• to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning \\ndeposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from \\nfloating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice \\nversa; \\n• to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities \\nportfolio; and \\n• to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, \\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \\nthe “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – \\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk” section and \\nNote 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and \\nNote 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \\nStatements in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \\nrates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \\nbasis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the \\ntrading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge \\neffectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair \\nvalue, and impairment of private equity investments.

These trading activities \\npredominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \\nextent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \\nfor trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and \\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \\nfinancial instruments used in our trading activities include net \\ninterest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and \\nlosses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \\nreflected in the interest income and interest expense \\ncomponents of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \\nin fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \\nadditional information on the financial instruments used in our \\ntrading activities and the income from these trading activities, \\nTable 25: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \\nmarkets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \\nsensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \\nmonitoring market risk. For additional information on our \\nmonitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see \\nthe “Risk Management – Asset/Liability Management – Market \\nRisk – Trading Activities” section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company’s trading positions. The \\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \\nto establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk \\nlimits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 25 shows the Company’s Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR \\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same \\nperiod a year ago, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio \\ncomposition. \\nQuarter ended \\nJune 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 June 30, 2022 \\nPeriod Period Period \\n(in millions) end Average Low High end Average Low High end Average Low High \\nCompany Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit 50 39 21 51 34 27 20 37 28 31 21 40 \\nInterest rate 42 44 29 65 40 32 19 48 26 23 11 35 \\nEquity 19 19 13 24 24 24 19 31 20 24 17 36 \\nCommodity 4 4 3 6 3 4 3 8 5 5 4 7 \\nForeign exchange 1 1 0 4 0 1 0 3 1 1 0 1 \\nDiversification benefit (1) (78) (72) (67) (49) (44) (52) \\nCompany Trading General VaR $ 38 35 34 39 36 32 \\n(1) The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly \\ncorrelated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may \\noccur on different days. \\nMARKET RISK – EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \\naffected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage \\ndirect investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth \\ncompanies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate \\nrecapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that \\nmake similar private equity investments. For additional \\ninformation, see the “Risk Management – Asset/Liability \\nManagement – Market Risk – Equity Securities” section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nWe also have marketable equity securities that include \\ninvestments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair \\nvalue changes in these marketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 \\n(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \\nmanagement and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \\nto repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \\nother business activities. Each business line monitors and \\nmanages these indirect risks. \\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \\nincurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to ensure that we can meet our contractual \\nobligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both \\nnormal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-\\nspecific and/or market stress. \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \\nmonitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \\nCorporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \\nthe Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \\nboth the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \\nthe Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries.

The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells Fargo. \\nWe are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \\nFDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \\nTable 26: Liquidity Coverage Ratio net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \\norganization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \\namount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \\ndebt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \\nderivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \\nperiod. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \\ntotal assets of $10 billion or more. As of June 30, 2023, we were \\ncompliant with the NSFR requirement. \\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio As of June 30, 2023, the Company, \\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West \\nexceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%. \\nTable 26 presents the Company’s quarterly average values for \\nthe daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant \\nto the LCR rule requirements.

Our objective is to maintain capital at an \\namount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance \\nobjectives, and to meet both regulatory and market \\nexpectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the \\nretention of earnings net of both dividends and share \\nrepurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock \\nand long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at June 30, \\n2023, increased $7.2 billion from December 31, 2022, \\npredominantly as a result of $9.9 billion of Wells Fargo net \\nincome, partially offset by $2.9 billion of common and preferred \\nstock dividends. During the first half of 2023, we issued \\n$860 million of common stock, substantially all of which was \\nissued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. \\nIn the first half of 2023, we repurchased 187 million shares of \\ncommon stock at a cost of $8.1 billion. For additional information \\nabout capital planning, see the “Capital Planning and Stress \\nTesting” section below. \\nIn July 2023, we issued $1.725 billion of our Preferred Stock, \\nSeries EE. \\nRegulatory Capital Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \\nregulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \\nratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \\nimplement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \\norganizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on a preliminary assessment of the \\nproposed rule. The Company is considering a range of potential \\nactions to address the impact of the proposed rule, including \\nbalance sheet and capital optimization strategies. \\nTable 31 and Table 32 present the risk-based capital \\nrequirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized \\nApproach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of June 30, \\n2023.

Because the stress \\ncapital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ \\nover time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are \\nsubject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for \\nthe period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is \\n3.20%. On July 27, 2023, the FRB confirmed that the Company’s \\nstress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2023, through \\nSeptember 30, 2024, will be 2.90%. \\nAs a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also \\nsubject to the FRB’s rule implementing an additional capital \\nsurcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio \\nrequirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually \\ncalculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \\nof the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \\nour size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \\nsubstitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \\nmethodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \\nBoard (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \\ninputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \\nTable 33: Capital Components and Ratios wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \\nthan under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \\ncalculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \\namount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \\nour annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \\nannual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our G-\\nSIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. On \\nJuly 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact \\nthe methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance \\nsheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories \\naccording to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the \\nnature of any collateral. The aggregate dollar amount in each risk \\ncategory is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with \\nthat category.

U.S. G-SIBs are required \\nto have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital \\nand additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or \\ncovered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid \\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus \\npayments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured \\nlong-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum \\nTLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of \\nJune 30, 2023, are presented in Table 41. \\nTable 41: Components Used to Calculate TLAC and Eligible Unsecured \\nLong-Term Debt Requirements \\nTLAC requirement \\nGreater of: \\n7.50% of total leverage exposure \\n18.00% of RWAs (the denominator of the SLR\\ncalculation) \\n+ + \\nExternal TLAC leverage buffer TLAC buffer (equal to 2.50% of RWAs \\n(equal to 2.00% of total leverage + method one G-SIB capital surcharge \\nexposure) + any countercyclical buffer) \\nMinimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt \\nGreater of: \\n6.00% of RWAs \\n+ 4.50% of total leverage exposure \\nGreater of method one and method \\ntwo G-SIB capital surcharge \\nThe FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the TLAC \\nand eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements.

As of June 30, 2023, these broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \\nminimum net capital requirements. \\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing \\nOur planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \\nregulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \\nour business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. \\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB \\nreviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the \\nDodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all \\nlarge BHCs and also reviews the Company’s proposed capital \\nactions. The FRB published its supervisory stress test results on \\nJune 28, 2023. \\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany's third quarter 2023 common stock dividend to $0.35 \\nper share. \\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\nWells Fargo & Company 50 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Although we announce \\nwhen the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not \\ngive any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various \\nfactors determine the amount of our share repurchases, \\nincluding our capital requirements, the number of shares we \\nexpect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, \\nmarket conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and \\nregulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB’s \\ncapital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the \\namount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be \\nRegulatory Matters in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations \\nunder our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various \\nprice levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any \\ntime. \\nAt June 30, 2023, we had remaining Board authority to \\nrepurchase approximately 64 million shares, subject to \\nregulatory and legal conditions. The Company publicly \\nannounced on July 25, 2023, that the Board authorized a new \\ncommon stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless \\nmodified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not \\nexpire and supersedes the prior share repurchase authority \\napproved by the Board. \\nFor additional information about share repurchases during \\nsecond quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report. \\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant \\nregulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation \\nand oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \\ncompanies conduct business and may continue to result in \\nincreased regulatory compliance costs. \\nFor a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the \\nCompany, see the “Overview” section in this Report. The \\nfollowing supplements our discussion of other significant \\nregulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have \\naffected or may affect our business contained in the “Regulatory \\nMatters” and “Risk Factors” sections in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\n“Living Will” Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \\nAct require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \\nprepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as \\n“living wills,” that would facilitate their rapid and orderly \\nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \\nUnder the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \\nreorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \\nperiod of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \\nrisk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the \\nfinancial stability of the United States. In addition to the \\nCompany’s resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the “Bank”), is also required to prepare and \\nperiodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\ndetermine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \\non us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we \\nadequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\nultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \\ndeficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \\noperations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the “orderly \\nliquidation authority.” The orderly liquidation authority allows for \\nthe appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \\nimportant financial institution that is in default or in danger of \\ndefault if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \\neffects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \\nappointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation \\nauthority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \\nobligations of our security holders. The FDIC’s orderly liquidation \\nauthority requires that security holders of a company in \\nreceivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \\nany losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \\ncreditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \\nstrict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \\nin certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \\nprocedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors’ \\nclaims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \\nHowever, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the \\nFDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \\nannounced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \\ndesirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \\nliquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \\nexercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is \\npossible. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \\nbanking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \\nmaintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \\nabsorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \\nbanking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding \\nthe failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \\nparent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \\ninstitutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \\nand liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \\norderly resolution. In response to the regulators’ guidance and to \\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \\n2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended \\nand restated on June 26, 2019 (the “Support Agreement”), with \\nWFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the “IHC”), the Bank, Wells Fargo \\nSecurities, LLC (“WFS”), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \\n(“WFCS”), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \\nfrom time to time as material entities for resolution planning \\npurposes (the “Covered Entities”) or identified from time to time \\nas related support entities in our resolution plan (the “Related \\nSupport Entities”).

If certain liquidity and/ \\nor capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent’s \\nboard of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the \\ncommitted line of credit would terminate, and the IHC’s ability to \\npay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which \\ncould materially and adversely impact the Parent’s liquidity and \\nits ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could \\nresult in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the \\nParent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if \\nthe Support Agreement were not implemented.

These policies govern: \\n• the allowance for credit losses; \\n• the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n• the fair value of financial instruments; \\n• income taxes; \\n• liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n• goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board’s Audit \\nCommittee.

The \\nUpdate requires a separate accounting \\npolicy election for each tax credit \\nprogram. For any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected, all investments within \\nthat program that meet eligibility \\ncriteria are required to apply the \\nproportional amortization method. The \\nUpdate also requires additional \\ndisclosures for any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected. The Update eliminates the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)-only scope limitation of the \\nproportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made \\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent \\naccounting method. Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at \\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. \\nThe amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are \\nrecorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified \\nretrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. \\nUpon adoption of the Update, we will identify our tax credit programs and make a separate accounting \\npolicy election as to whether to apply the proportional amortization method for each program. For any \\ninvestments that will apply the proportional amortization method upon adoption of the Update, the \\ncumulative effect of the difference between the current carrying value and the carrying value under the \\nproportional amortization method will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained \\nearnings, the period of which is dependent upon which transition method is selected. \\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements. \\nOther Accounting Developments \\nThe following Update is applicable to us but is not expected to \\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements: \\n• ASU 2022-03 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair \\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual \\nSale Restrictions \\nWells Fargo & Company 54 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We provide banking, investment and mortgage \\nproducts and services, as well as consumer and commercial \\nfinance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and \\nother distribution channels to individuals, businesses and \\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in \\ncountries outside the U.S. When we refer to “Wells Fargo,” “the \\nCompany,” “we,” “our” or “us,” we mean Wells Fargo & Company \\nand Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. For discussion of our significant \\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were \\nno material changes to these policies in the first half of 2023. \\nTo prepare the financial statements in conformity with \\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on \\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for \\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the \\ndate of the financial statements, income and expenses during the \\nreporting period and the related disclosures. Although our \\nestimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect \\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual \\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, \\nwhich could materially affect our results of operations and \\nfinancial condition. Management has made significant estimates \\nin several areas, including: \\n• allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \\n• valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n• valuations of financial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities)); \\n• liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 10 (Legal \\nActions)); \\n• income taxes; and \\n• goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nThese unaudited interim financial statements reflect all \\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary \\nfor a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. \\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless \\notherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations \\nin the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the \\nresults that may be expected for the full year. The interim \\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction with our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \\nIn 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n• Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n• ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method \\n• ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers \\n• ASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates \\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis. \\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans. \\nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \\nexpands an entity's ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \\nfor interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \\nassets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \\nWells Fargo & Company 65 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566 million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \\nsecurities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities) for additional information about the Company's \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11 \\n(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships. \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by \\n$176 million and $44 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2022. \\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income and consolidated balance sheet for the three and six \\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022. \\nThese adjustments are also reflected in our consolidated \\nstatement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of \\ncash flows. \\nWells Fargo & Company 66 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The credit quality \\nindicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings \\nand delinquency status and are based on information as of our \\nfinancial statement date. \\nCREDIT RATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit \\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a \\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by \\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). \\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings \\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are \\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities \\nrated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by \\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher \\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt \\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit \\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management \\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major \\ncredit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated \\nby NRSROs at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined \\nto be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based \\non internal credit grades. \\nWells Fargo & Company 70 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our commercial lending commitments include, but are \\nnot limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general \\ncorporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse \\nfinancial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate \\nloans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced \\nwith other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real \\nestate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending \\ncommitments under which commercial customers have the \\noption to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including \\nthe issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded \\ncommitment amounts of the facility. \\nThe maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these \\ncommitments may expire without being used or may be \\ncancelled at the customer’s request. We may reduce or cancel \\nlines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable \\nlaw. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the \\namount of commitments, both to individual customers and in \\ntotal, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. \\nWe do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are \\nunconditionally cancellable at our discretion. \\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in \\npurchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At \\nJune 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had $1.2 billion and \\n$1.8 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial \\nletters of credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other \\nCommitments) for additional information on issued standby \\nletters of credit. We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a \\nrepresentative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide \\nfor the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or \\nletter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in \\nless than a week and would normally require default of both the \\ncustomer and another lender to expose us to loss. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized \\nin Table 5.4. The table is presented net of commitments \\nsyndicated to others, including the fronting arrangements \\ndescribed above, and excludes issued letters of credit and \\ndiscretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required \\nprior to any loan funding or commitment increase. \\nTable 5.4: Unfunded Credit Commitments \\nJun 30, Dec 31, \\n(in millions) 2023 2022 \\nCommercial and industrial (1) $ 385,949 388,504 \\nCommercial real estate 25,348 29,518 \\nTotal commercial 411,297 418,022 \\nResidential mortgage (2) 34,668 39,155 \\nCredit card 157,271 145,526 \\nOther consumer (3) 78,032 69,244 \\nTotal consumer 269,971 253,925 \\nTotal unfunded credit commitments $ 681,268 671,947 \\n(1) Effective first quarter 2023, unfunded credit commitments exclude discretionary amounts \\nwhere our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment \\nincrease.

Our ratings \\nare aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized \\ncategories with the criticized segmented among special mention, \\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss categories. \\nTable 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our \\ncommercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality \\ninformation by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans \\nmay convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in \\nthe original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower \\nexperiencing financial difficulty.

Loan \\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\\nto-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \\nloan portfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class are \\nincluded in the following tables for the six months ended June 30, \\n2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management \\npractices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality \\nindicator for our loan portfolio. \\nMany of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \\nis an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \\nour ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is \\nprovided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a \\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty. \\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores \\nare generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9 provides the outstanding balances of our \\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality \\nindicators. \\nLTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s outstanding \\nbalance to the property’s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) \\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien \\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line \\nproducts) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade \\napproach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less \\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs \\nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV \\nor CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 82 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis. \\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $132 million at June 30, 2023. \\nTable 5.15: Commercial Loan Modifications Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked. \\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid \\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized \\ncost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in \\nthe disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost \\nbalances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is \\nexcluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for \\nadditional information on accrued interest receivable. Borrowers \\nexperiencing financial difficulty with modified terms mandated \\nby a bankruptcy court are considered contractually modified \\nloans and are included in these disclosures.

The \\nfollowing disclosures present TDR information for the periods \\nended December 31, 2022, and June 30, 2022.

We do not \\nconsider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a \\nTDR. In addition, COVID-19-related modifications are generally \\nnot classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and \\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional information on the \\nTDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing \\nfinancial difficulty to make trial payments, generally for a period \\nof three to four months, according to the terms of a planned \\npermanent modification, to determine if they can perform \\naccording to those terms. These arrangements represent trial \\nmodifications, which we classified and accounted for as TDRs \\nthrough December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU \\n2022-02. While loans are in trial payment programs, their original \\nterms are not considered modified and they continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. \\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans whose \\nterms have been modified in a TDR amounted to $434 million at \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nTable 5.17 summarizes our TDR modifications by primary \\nmodification type and includes the financial effects of these \\nmodifications.

The reported amounts include loans remodified of $132 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2022, and $250 million for the first \\nhalf of 2022. \\n(2) Other concessions include loans with payment (principal and/or interest) deferral, loans discharged in bankruptcy, loan renewals, term extensions and other interest and noninterest adjustments, but \\nexclude modifications that also forgive principal and/or reduce the contractual interest rate.

The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged \\ndown prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. \\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest rate reduction reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans \\nreported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. \\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue \\ninterest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial \\neffect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the \\ncurrent period. \\nTable 5.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that \\ndefaulted during the period presented within 12 months of their \\npermanent modification date.

These proceedings \\nand investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo \\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related \\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our \\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our \\nsubsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \\notherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \\nof investigations of other persons or industry groups. \\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \\nassociated with the actions become probable and the costs can \\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the \\namount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of \\npotential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if \\nwe cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low \\nend of the range of those potential losses. There can be no \\nassurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including \\nthe matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving \\nlegal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the \\namounts accrued for those actions. \\nAUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company \\nentered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of \\nthe Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by \\nthe agencies into the Company’s compliance risk management \\nprogram and its past practices involving certain automobile \\ncollateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain \\nmortgage interest rate lock extensions. Shareholders filed a \\nputative securities fraud class action against the Company and its \\nexecutive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions \\nof CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In \\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants \\nexcept the Company and a former executive officer and limited \\nthe action to two alleged misstatements. On May 1, 2023, the \\ncourt granted preliminary approval of an agreement pursuant to \\nwhich the Company agreed to pay $300 million to resolve this \\naction. Additionally, a number of other lawsuits were filed by \\nnon-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies \\nrelated to these CPI policies and related to the unused portion of \\nguaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance \\nagreements. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into \\nvarious settlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others were \\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, \\nincluding the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, \\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues \\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer \\nauto loans, including related insurance products. On \\nDecember 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to \\nautomobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage \\nlending. The consent order requires, among other things, \\nremediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil \\npenalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company \\nentered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state \\nattorneys general. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department \\nof Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \\nthe Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \\n401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \\nthe Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \\ndisclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \\nthe Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, \\nparticipants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class \\naction in the United States District Court for the District of \\nMinnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \\ncertain of these transactions. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo \\nshareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action \\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of \\nNew York alleging that the Company and certain of its current \\nand former executive officers and directors made false or \\nmisleading statements regarding the Company’s efforts to \\ncomply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal \\nReserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB \\nand OCC. On May 16, 2023, the court granted preliminary \\napproval of an agreement pursuant to which the Company \\nagreed to pay $1.0 billion to resolve this action. Allegations \\nrelated to the Company’s efforts to comply with these three \\nconsent orders are also among the subjects of shareholder \\nderivative lawsuits filed in California state and federal court. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the United States \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or \\ninformal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company’s \\nhiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud \\nclass action has also been filed in the United States District Court \\nfor the Northern District of California alleging that the Company \\nand certain of its executive officers made false or misleading \\nstatements about the Company’s hiring practices related to \\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices \\nrelated to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder \\nderivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California and in California state court. \\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \\nmerchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \\nwith Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \\nMasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \\ncompanies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \\nactions have been consolidated in the United States District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \\non alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \\ndamages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \\nthat Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \\ntying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \\nanticompetitive.

On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \\nconsolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \\n$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \\nopting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \\ndefault interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior \\nclass counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, \\nseeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second \\nCircuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, \\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead \\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. \\nThe parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve \\nthe damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a \\ntotal of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately \\n$5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and \\n$900 million in additional funding. The Company’s allocated \\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately \\n$94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement \\non December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector \\nmerchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the \\ndamages class settlement. Settlement objector merchants filed a \\npetition for a rehearing by the Second Circuit en banc, which was \\ndenied. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the \\nplaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the equitable relief \\ncase. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have \\nbeen settled while others remain pending. \\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS The United States Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity \\nFutures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations \\nregarding the Company’s compliance with records retention \\nrequirements relating to business communications sent over \\nunapproved electronic messaging channels. The Company is in \\nresolution discussions with these agencies, although there can be \\nno assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. \\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank in New York state court, and Park Royal I \\nLLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, \\nthe plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action \\nbased upon, among other things, the trustee’s alleged failure to \\nnotify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan \\nsellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, \\nnotify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by \\nappropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. \\nIn July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light’s claims \\nand certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and \\nsubsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and \\nCommerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s decision to \\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \\nPhoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, terminating its \\ncase. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by \\ninstitutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit \\nUnion Administration with similar allegations. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. \\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.5 billion as of June 30, \\n2023. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and \\nsubject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \\ndetermine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \\ninherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \\nmay be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \\npossible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \\nmay be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \\nreasonably possible loss. Based on information currently \\navailable, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and \\nestablished reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual \\noutcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its \\nsubsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s consolidated financial \\ncondition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a \\nmatter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo’s results \\nof operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 97 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nBalance Sheet Offsetting \\nWe execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under \\nmaster netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these \\nmaster netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of \\ndefault by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as \\ncollateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same \\ncounterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash \\ncollateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on \\na net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net \\nnon-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative \\nbalances on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nFor disclosure purposes, we present “Total Derivatives, net” \\nwhich represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each \\ncounterparty after considering the balance sheet netting adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative \\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each \\ncounterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using \\nmaster netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. \\nTable 11.2 provides information on the fair values of \\nderivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master \\nnetting arrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments \\nand the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral \\nassociated with such arrangements. In addition to the netting \\namounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting \\nrelated to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed \\nwithin Note 15 (Pledged Assets and Collateral). \\nWells Fargo & Company 98 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert \\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of \\ndeposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nrisk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure \\nto foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the \\nissuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use \\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against \\nchanges in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale \\n(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign \\ncurrency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest \\nrate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated \\namounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain \\nfair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of \\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency \\nbasis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the \\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income. \\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to \\nchanges in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use \\ncross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments \\non fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due \\nto changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $947 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30, 2023, will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths. For cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2023, we are \\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the \\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for \\na maximum of 9 years. For additional information on our \\naccounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTable 11.3 and Table 11.4 show the net gains (losses) related \\nto derivatives in cash flow and fair value hedging relationships, \\nrespectively. \\nWells Fargo & Company 99 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We generally use \\ncredit derivatives to assist customers with their risk \\nmanagement objectives by purchasing and selling credit \\nprotection on corporate debt obligations through the use of \\ncredit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help \\nmanage counterparty exposure. We would be required to \\nperform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of \\ndefault by the referenced obligors. Events of default include \\nevents such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of \\nprincipal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 11.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 11.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\nProtection sold – \\nnon-investment \\n(in millions) Protection sold grade \\nJune 30, 2023 \\nCredit default swaps $ 14,273 1,677 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,460 6,250 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 20,733 7,927 \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCredit default swaps $ 12,733 1,860 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,728 6,518 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 19,461 8,378 \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of \\nrecovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from \\ncollateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a \\nhigher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the \\ncredit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is \\ninvestment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify \\nthe credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit \\nderivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order \\nto achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk \\nmanagement is designed to provide an ability to recover a \\nsignificant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold \\ncredit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if \\nthe credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain \\nmajor credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand \\nadditional collateral or require termination or replacement of \\nderivative instruments in a net liability position.

These nonrecurring adjustments \\ntypically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \\n(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \\napplication of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis are presented in Table 12.4 in this Note. We provide in \\nTable 12.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \\nare not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \\ncarried at amortized cost. \\nSee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in \\nour 2022 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair \\nvalue. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for \\nassets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or \\nnonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \\nbased on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \\nlowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K for a \\ndetailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \\nconsider all available information, including observable market \\ndata, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \\nused. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nthe unobservable inputs to the instruments’ fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \\nconsidered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \\nmeasure fair value.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include: \\n• underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities; \\n• providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n• entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n• holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n• acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n• providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n• providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored \\nentities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into \\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain \\ncredit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer \\nmortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to \\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines \\nwhich are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \\nor guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or \\nGNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA \\ndesign the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the \\ninvolved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant \\nto the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which \\nbecomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments \\nremain unpaid by the borrower. When we do not repurchase \\nthese loans, they are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet \\nand pledged to the GNMA securitization. We repurchased loans \\nof $99 million and $191 million, during the second quarter and \\nfirst half of 2023, respectively, and $564 million and $1.5 billion \\nduring the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. In \\n2022, these predominantly represented repurchases of \\ngovernment insured loans. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, \\n2022, we recorded assets and related liabilities of $940 million \\nand $743 million, respectively, where we did not exercise our \\noption to repurchase eligible loans. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our \\nliability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was \\n$162 million and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $13.8 billion at both June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that \\nwe design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, \\nand accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit \\nrisk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We \\ntypically originate the transferred loans and account for the \\ntransfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the \\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, \\nsuch as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our \\nservicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage \\nloan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We \\ndo not consolidate the VIE because the most significant \\ndecisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally \\nmade by the special servicer or the controlling class security \\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold \\nvariable interests that we consider potentially significant or are \\nnot the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 13.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2.

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This \\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or \\nrisk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the \\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities \\nissued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not \\nconsolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-\\nmaking power with third parties and do not hold significant \\neconomic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making \\nactivities. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe transferred securities of $6.1 billion and $12.6 billion, \\nrespectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained securities of \\n$329 million and $525 million, respectively.

For additional information \\nabout these VIEs, see the “Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” \\nsection within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations also include commercial mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations sponsored by third parties where we did not \\noriginate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and \\ninvest in securities that could be potentially significant to the \\nVIE. \\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization \\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from \\nTable 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have \\npower over the activities most significant to the VIEs. \\nAdditionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the \\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these \\nVIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming \\nmortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the \\n“Loan Sales and Securitization Activity” and “Resecuritization \\nActivities” sections within this Note. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased \\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to \\nVIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire \\nsuch beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a \\ntransferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also \\nservice the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the \\nbonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and \\nworkout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore \\nwe do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of \\nstructured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including \\nasset-backed finance structures and other securitizations \\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral \\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student \\nloans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or \\nmarketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service \\none or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives \\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We \\nare not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we \\ndo not have power to direct the most significant activities of the \\nVIEs. Table 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the \\nunconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes \\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity \\nagreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude \\ncertain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our \\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature \\nor insignificant in size. \\nIn Table 13.4, “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the \\nmost current information available. “Carrying value” is the \\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our \\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure \\nto loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in \\nthe VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that \\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity \\nand lending commitments, the notional amount of net written \\nderivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or \\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and \\ncertain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, \\nsold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for \\nwhich we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset \\nfrom any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an \\nindication of expected loss. \\nWells Fargo & Company 117 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The \\nprojects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have \\nthe power over the VIE’s assets, therefore, we do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax \\ncredit VIEs was $19.0 billion and $18.7 billion at June 30, 2023, \\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. We also had loans to tax \\ncredit VIEs with a carrying value of $2.0 billion at both June 30, \\n2023, and December 31, 2022. \\nOur maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at \\nJune 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $29.7 billion and \\n$28.0 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss \\nincluded total unfunded equity and lending commitments of \\n$8.8 billion and $7.3 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, \\n2022, respectively. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other \\nCommitments) for additional information about commitments \\nto purchase equity securities. \\nOur affordable housing equity investments qualify for the \\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For additional \\ninformation on our LIHTC investments, see Note 16 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Consolidated VIEs \\nWe consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We \\nare the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: \\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may \\nsecuritize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust \\nentity. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the key \\ndecisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE \\nassets held by the master trust represent a majority of the total \\nVIE assets presented for this category in Table 13.5. In a separate \\ntransaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and \\nequity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to \\nspecific vendors and service the underlying collateral. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other VIEs are predominantly related to \\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are \\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the \\nissuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with \\nMTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which \\nprovides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the \\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued \\nto investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage \\nloans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the \\nunderlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities \\nissued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the \\noutstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the \\nrelated debt associated with such securitizations. \\nWells Fargo & Company 118 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $172 million and $157 million with related collateral of $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion \\nas of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. \\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \\nthat would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \\ncircumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in \\nTable 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could \\nuse to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \\nagreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \\nthe guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \\nthe credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \\ndetermined based on an external rating or an internal credit \\ngrade that is below investment grade. \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency \\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \\nderivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \\nThe fair value of written options represents our view of the \\nprobability that we will be required to perform under the \\ncontract. The fair value of these written options was an asset of \\n$449 million and a liability of $15 million at June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value may be an asset \\nas a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The \\nmaximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these \\nderivative contracts. At June 30, 2023, the maximum exposure \\nto loss was $31.8 billion, with $29.3 billion expiring in three years \\nor less compared with $23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. See Note 11 (Derivatives) \\nfor additional information regarding written derivative contracts. \\nREPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES We record a liability for \\nmortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various \\nrepresentations or warranties. See Note 13 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) for further discussion and related \\namounts. Additionally, when we sell MSRs, we may provide \\nindemnifications for losses incurred due to material breaches of \\ncontractual representations or warranties as well as other \\nrecourse arrangements. At June 30, 2023, our liability for these \\nindemnification arrangements was $8 million and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $650 million, with $609 million expiring in \\nthree years or less. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks \\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \\nconnection with payment and delivery disputes between the \\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We \\nestimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total \\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four \\nmonths, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back \\ntransaction. As of June 30, 2023, our potential maximum \\nexposure was approximately $789.5 billion, and related losses, \\nincluding those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. \\nWells Fargo & Company 120 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These activities are \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \\nactivities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \\nU.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \\nsecurities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \\nour commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 15.2 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \\nmaster securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \\nsame counterparty. Collateralized financings, and those with a \\nsingle counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit \\nbalance sheet netting. The majority of transactions subject to \\nthese agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not \\neligible for balance sheet netting. \\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \\nsuch as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet against the related liability.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \\nobligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction’s \\nmaturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \\namounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. We define our \\nreportable operating segments by type of product and customer \\nsegment, and their results are based on our management \\nreporting process. The management reporting process measures \\nthe performance of the reportable operating segments based on \\nthe Company’s management structure, and the results are \\nregularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant \\nsenior management. The management reporting process is \\nbased on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as \\nfunds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared \\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial \\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with \\nannual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products \\nand services include checking and savings accounts, credit and \\ndebit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business \\nlending. \\nCommercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, \\nfamily owned and certain public companies. Products and \\nservices include banking and credit products across multiple \\nindustry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease \\nproducts, and treasury management. \\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital \\nmarkets, banking, and financial products and services to \\ncorporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional \\nclients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, \\ninvestment banking, treasury management, commercial real \\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as \\nwell as sales, trading, and research capabilities. \\nWealth and Investment Management provides personalized \\nwealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, \\nprivate banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to \\naffluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We \\noperate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth \\noffices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and \\ndigitally through WellsTrade ® and Intuitive Investor ®. Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, \\nnet of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, \\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable \\noperating segments as well as our investment portfolio and \\naffiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. \\nCorporate also includes certain lines of business that \\nmanagement has determined are no longer consistent with the \\nlong-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for \\npreviously divested businesses. \\nBasis of Presentation \\nFUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nREVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nWells Fargo & Company 125 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We must calculate our risk-based capital ratios \\nTable 21.1: Regulatory Capital Information under both the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. The \\nStandardized Approach applies assigned risk weights to broad \\nrisk categories, while the calculation of risk-weighted assets \\n(RWAs) under the Advanced Approach differs by requiring \\napplicable banks to utilize a risk-sensitive methodology, which \\nrelies upon the use of internal credit models, and includes an \\noperational risk component. \\nAt June 30, 2023, the Bank and our other insured depository \\ninstitutions were considered well-capitalized under the \\nrequirements of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. \\nWells Fargo & Company Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. \\nStandardized Approach Advanced Approach Standardized Approach Advanced Approach \\nDecember 31, December 31, December 31, December 31, \\n(in millions, except ratios) June 30, 2023 2022 June 30, 2023 2022 June 30, 2023 2022 June 30, 2023 2022 \\nRegulatory capital: \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 $ 134,221 133,527 134,221 133,527 142,300 140,644 142,300 140,644 \\nTier 1 153,201 152,567 153,201 152,567 142,300 140,644 142,300 140,644 \\nTotal 187,563 186,747 176,926 177,258 166,077 163,885 155,862 154,292 \\nAssets: \\nRisk-weighted assets 1,250,690 1,259,889 1,118,379 1,112,307 1,153,795 1,177,300 975,072 977,713 \\nAdjusted average assets 1,850,084 1,846,954 1,850,084 1,846,954 1,651,211 1,685,401 1,651,211 1,685,401 \\nRegulatory capital ratios: \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital 10.73 % * 10.60 12.00 12.00 12.33 * 11.95 14.59 14.39 \\nTier 1 capital 12.25 * 12.11 13.70 13.72 12.33 * 11.95 14.59 14.39 \\nTotal capital 15.00 * 14.82 15.82 15.94 14.39 * 13.92 15.98 15.78 \\nRequired minimum capital ratios: \\nCommon Equity Tier 1 capital 9.20 9.20 8.50 8.50 7.00 7.00 7.00 7.00 \\nTier 1 capital 10.70 10.70 10.00 10.00 8.50 8.50 8.50 8.50 \\nTotal capital 12.70 12.70 12.00 12.00 10.50 10.50 10.50 10.50 \\nWells Fargo & Company Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. \\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 \\nRegulatory leverage: \\nTotal leverage exposure (1) $ 2,217,575 2,224,789 2,005,228 2,058,568 \\nSupplementary leverage ratio (SLR) (1) 6.91 % 6.86 7.10 6.83 \\nTier 1 leverage ratio (2) 8.28 8.26 8.62 8.34 \\nRequired minimum leverage: \\nSupplementary leverage ratio 5.00 5.00 6.00 6.00 \\nTier 1 leverage ratio 4.00 4.00 4.00 4.00 \\n* Denotes the binding ratio under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches at June 30, 2023. \\n(1) The SLR consists of Tier 1 capital divided by total leverage exposure.

In addition, the \\nCET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratio requirements for the \\nCompany included a stress capital buffer of 3.20% under the \\nStandardized Approach and a capital conservation buffer of \\n2.50% under the Advanced Approach. The capital ratio \\nrequirements for the Bank included a capital conservation buffer \\nof 2.50% under both the Standardized and Advanced \\nApproaches. The Company is required to maintain these risk-\\nbased capital ratios and to maintain an SLR of at least 5.00% \\n(composed of a 3.00% minimum requirement plus a \\nsupplementary leverage buffer of 2.00%) to avoid restrictions on \\ncapital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

See the “Glossary of Acronyms” for definitions of terms used \\nthroughout this Report. \\xa0\\nFinancial Review\\nOverview\\nWells\\xa0Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \\nthat has approximately $1.9 trillion  in assets, proudly serves one \\nin three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses \\nin the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the \\nU.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and \\nmortgage products and services, as well as consumer and \\ncommercial finance, through our four reportable operating \\nsegments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, \\nCorporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment \\nManagement. Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune’s\\xa0 2023 \\nrankings of America’s largest corporations. We ranked fourth in \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among \\nall U.S. banks at September\\xa030, 2023 .\\xa0\\nWells Fargo’s top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business, \\noperations, products and services, and risk management \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience \\nissues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. \\nWe are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we \\nimplement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result \\nin additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others, and \\nregulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues. \\nFailure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a \\ntimely basis could result in additional penalties, business \\nrestrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, \\nincreased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, \\nand other negative consequences, which could be significant. \\nWhile we still have significant work to do and have not yet \\nsatisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the \\nCompany is committed to devoting the resources necessary to \\noperate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the \\nhighest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in \\nplace.\\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management\\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company’s Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board’s governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company’s compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB’s \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company’s \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company’s total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.\\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions\\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company’s compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest \\nrate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the \\nCompany submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide \\ncompliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the \\nCompany’s internal audit program with respect to federal \\nconsumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In \\naddition, as required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers \\naffected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and \\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the \\nmanagement of remediation activities conducted by the \\nCompany.

In addition, the consent \\norder restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nresidential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \\nmortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \\nCompany’s mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \\nprovided.\\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \\nLending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \\nLending\\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \\norder with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \\nremediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \\nconsumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \\npractices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \\nrefunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \\nprotection agreements; comply with certain business practice \\nrequirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \\n$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions.\\nRetail Sales Practices Matters\\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired.\\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk \\nFactors” section in our 2022 Form\\xa010-K .\\nCustomer Remediation Activities\\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort.\\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \\nhad approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $2.3 billion of \\naccrued liabilities for customer remediation activities as of \\nSeptember 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. As \\nour ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen \\nour risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in \\nthe future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. \\nTo the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any \\ncustomer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have \\npreviously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding these activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the “Risk Factors” \\nsection in our 2022 Form\\xa010-K .\\nRecent Developments\\nDebit Card Interchange Fees\\nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \\nreduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \\ndebit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \\nan update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \\nbased on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \\nissuers. Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect a \\nsignificant reduction to our debit card interchange fees, which \\nare included in card fees, if the rule is adopted as currently \\nproposed.\\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment\\nIn May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \\nproposed a rule to recover by special assessment losses to the \\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the \\nfirst half of 2023. Under the proposed rule, the FDIC would \\ncollect a special assessment based on a calculation using an \\ninsured depository institution’s estimated amount of uninsured \\ndeposits. As currently proposed, the amount of our special \\nassessment may be up to $1.8 billion (pre-tax). We expect to \\nexpense the entire amount upon the FDIC’s finalization of the \\nrule, which we expect to occur in fourth quarter 2023. The \\nproposed rule may be changed prior to finalization and any \\nchanges may affect the timing or amount of the special \\nassessment.\\nCapital Matters\\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \\nrule that would impact the way in which risk-based capital \\nrequirements are determined for certain banks. The proposed \\nrule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach and replace \\nit with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \\naddress the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \\nand capital optimization strategies.\\nFor additional information about capital planning, see the \\n“Capital Management – Capital Planning and Stress Testing” \\nsection in this Report.\\nFinancial Performance\\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12\\nIn first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards \\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 – \\nFinancial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted \\nImprovements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts . \\nWe adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \\nrequired revision of prior period financial statements. Prior \\nperiod risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related \\nmetrics were not revised.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5 . We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments.\\nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury.\\nRevenue and Expense Sharing   When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements.When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided.\\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results.\\nAllocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January\\xa01, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment’s use of capital.\\nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\noperating segments or lines of business.\\nTable 5:   Management Reporting Structure\\nWells Fargo & Company\\nConsumer \\nBanking and \\nLendingCommercial \\nBankingCorporate and \\nInvestment \\nBankingWealth and \\nInvestment \\nManagementCorporate\\n• Consumer, Small \\nand Business \\nBanking\\n• Home Lending\\n• Credit Card\\n• Auto\\n• Personal Lending• Middle Market \\nBanking\\n• Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing• Banking\\n• Commercial Real \\nEstate\\n• Markets• Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors\\n• The Private\\nBank• Corporate \\nTreasury\\n• Enterprise \\nFunctions\\n• Investment \\nPortfolio\\n• Venture capital \\nand private equity \\ninvestments\\n• Non-strategic \\nbusinessesEarnings Performance  (continued)\\n12 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

See Note 6  (Mortgage Banking Activities ) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer \\nadvances and servicing fees.\\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines , upon \\ntransfer  as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \\ncertain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \\nbased on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \\npayments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \\nliability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to \\nrepurchase the loan.

For \\ninformation on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the “Risk \\nManagement – Asset/Liability Management” section in our 2022 \\nForm\\xa010-K .\\nINTEREST RATE RISK  Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \\ncan cause a loss of the Company’s earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the Company’s asset and liability cash flows \\nprimarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending \\nand deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because:\\n• assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest \\nrates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase or \\nwhen interest rates are generally falling, earnings will initially \\ndecrease;\\n• assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by \\ndifferent amounts;\\n• short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nby different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield \\ncurve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs \\ndifferently;\\n• the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if \\nlong-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, \\nmortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate \\nthan anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or\\n• interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan \\ndemand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage \\norigination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other \\nfinancial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the \\ndegree of change over time, the speed of change and the \\nprojected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require \\nassumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet \\ncomposition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans \\nand debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing \\nstrategies.\\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24 , \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months \\nusing instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both \\nlower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. \\nSteeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in \\nthe yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors \\nthree years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as \\nall tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar \\ninterest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the \\nsimulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24 :\\n• Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to \\nour assets and liabilities.\\n• Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant.\\n• Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates.\\nWells Fargo & Company 39', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our interest rate \\nsensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher \\ninterest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater \\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest \\nrates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree \\nthan our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income.

In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2  \\n(Trading Activities ) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage \\nour interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in \\nthe fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers \\nthe amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes \\nunrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt \\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized \\ninto earnings over the life of the security with no further impact \\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1  (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies ) and Note 3  (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities ) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We \\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in the following \\nmain ways:\\n• to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning \\ndeposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from \\nfloating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice \\nversa;\\n• to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities \\nportfolio; and\\n• to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, \\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs.\\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 11  (Derivatives ) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\\xa0  We \\noriginate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans.\\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate “locks”) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates.

For \\nadditional information, see Note 4  (Equity Securities ) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report.\\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \\nmanagement and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \\nto repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \\nother business activities. Each business line monitors and \\nmanages these indirect risks.LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING   Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they \\ncome due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \\nincurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to ensure that we can meet our contractual \\nobligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both \\nnormal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-\\nspecific and/or market stress. \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets.

For \\nadditional information on liquidity risk and funding management, \\nsee the “Risk Management – Liquidity Risk and Funding” section \\nin our 2022  Form 10-K.\\nLiquidity Standards   We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, \\nOCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity \\nrequirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) \\nestablished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \\n(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells\\xa0Fargo.We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \\nFDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \\nnet stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \\norganization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \\namount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \\ndebt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \\nderivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \\nperiod. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \\ntotal assets of $10\\xa0billion or more. As of September\\xa030, 2023 , we \\nwere compliant with the NSFR requirement.\\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio  As of September\\xa030, 2023 , the \\nCompany, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank \\nWest exceeded  the minimum LCR requirement of 100%.\\nTable 26  presents the Company’s quarterly average values for \\nthe daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant \\nto the LCR rule requirements. The LCR represents average HQLA \\ndivided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is \\ndefined under the LCR rule. \\nTable 26:   Liquidity Coverage Ratio\\nAverage for quarter ended\\n(in millions, except ratio) Sep 30, 2023 Jun 30, 2023 Sep 30, 2022\\nHQLA (1):\\nEligible cash $ 154,258  121,126  125,576 \\nEligible securities (2)  191,606  227,955  238,678 \\nTotal HQLA  345,864  349,081  364,254 \\nProjected net cash outflows (3)  280,468  283,609  296,495 \\nLCR  123%  123  123 \\n(1) Excludes excess HQLA at certain subsidiaries that are not transferable to other Wells Fargo entities.\\n(2) Net of applicable haircuts required under the LCR rule.\\n(3) Projected net cash outflows are calculated by applying a standardized set of outflow and inflow assumptions, defined by the LCR rule, to various exposures and liability types, such as deposits and \\nunfunded loan commitments, which are prescribed based on a number of factors, including the type of customer and the nature of the account.\\nLiquidity Sources   We maintain liquidity in the form of cash, \\ninterest-earning deposits with banks, and unencumbered high-\\nquality, liquid debt securities. These assets make up our primary \\nsources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are \\nsubstantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR \\nrule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable \\nhaircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our \\nsubsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule.

The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted  assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule.

We believe that our long-\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \\nour business, satisfy our customers’ financial needs in varying \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers.\\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells\\xa0Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans.\\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test.

The \\nUpdate requires a separate accounting \\npolicy election for each tax credit \\nprogram. For any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected, all investments within \\nthat program that meet eligibility \\ncriteria are required to apply the \\nproportional amortization method. The \\nUpdate also requires additional \\ndisclosures for any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected.The Update eliminates the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)-only scope limitation of the \\nproportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made \\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent \\naccounting method. Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at \\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. \\nThe amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are \\nrecorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified \\nretrospective basis and early adoption is permitted.\\nUpon adoption of the Update, we will identify our tax credit programs and make a separate accounting \\npolicy election as to whether to apply the proportional amortization method for each program. For any \\ninvestments that will apply the proportional amortization method upon adoption of the Update, the \\ncumulative effect of the difference between the current carrying value and the carrying value under the \\nproportional amortization method will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained \\nearnings, the period of which is dependent upon which transition method is selected. \\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements.\\nOther Accounting Developments\\nThe following Update is applicable to us but is not expected to \\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements:\\n• ASU 2022-03 – Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair \\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual \\nSale Restrictions\\nWells Fargo & Company 53', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany.  We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding.\\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. For discussion of our significant \\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were \\nno material changes to these policies in the first nine months of \\n2023 .\\nTo prepare the financial statements in conformity with \\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on \\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for \\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the \\ndate of the financial statements, income and expenses during the \\nreporting period and the related disclosures. Although our \\nestimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect \\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual \\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, \\nwhich could materially affect our results of operations and \\nfinancial condition. Management has made significant estimates \\nin several areas, including:\\n• allowance for credit losses ( Note 5  (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses )); \\n• valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6  (Mortgage Banking Activities ) and Note 13  \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities )); \\n• valuations of financial instruments ( Note 12  (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities ));\\n• liabilities for contingent litigation losses ( Note 10  (Legal \\nActions ));\\n• income taxes; and\\n• goodwill impairment ( Note 7  (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets )).\\nActual results could differ from those estima tes.\\nThese unaudited interim financial statements reflect all \\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary \\nfor a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. \\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless \\notherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations \\nin the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the \\nresults that may be expected for the full year. The interim \\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction with our 2022 \\nForm 10-K.Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023\\nIn 2023 , we adopted the following new accounting guidance:\\n• Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments  – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures\\n• ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method\\n• ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers\\n• ASU 2018-12, Financial Services – Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates\\nASU 2022-02  eliminates the accounting and reporting for \\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5  (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses ) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis.\\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million , pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million , after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans.Notes to Financial Statements \\n64 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method.\\nWe adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023 on a \\nprospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders’ equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio.\\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date.\\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion  and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion  from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion  as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566\\xa0million  of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \\nsecurities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3  (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities ) for additional information about the Company's \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11  \\n(Derivatives ) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships.  \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 – Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 – Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12  changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder’s account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts.\\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by \\n$176\\xa0million  and $44\\xa0million , respectively, as of January 1, 2022.\\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs.

The credit quality \\nindicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings \\nand delinquency status and are based on information as of our \\nfinancial statement date. \\nCREDIT RATINGS  Credit ratings express opinions about the credit \\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a \\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by \\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). \\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings \\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are \\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities \\nrated below investment grade, labeled as “speculative grade” by \\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher \\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt \\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit \\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management \\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major \\ncredit agencies. Substantially all  of our debt securities were rated \\nby NRSROs at September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, 2022 . \\nTable 3.4  shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined \\nto be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based \\non internal credit grades.\\nWells Fargo & Company 69', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Loan \\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\\nto-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \\nloan portfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class are \\nincluded in the following tables for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2023 , which we monitor as part of our credit risk \\nmanagement practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary \\ncredit quality indicator for our loan portfolio. \\nMany of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \\nis an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \\nour ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is \\nprovided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a \\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty.\\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are \\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9  provides the outstanding balances of our \\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality \\nindicators. \\nLTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan’s outstanding \\nbalance to the property’s collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) \\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien \\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line \\nproducts) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade \\napproach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1 million  or more, as the AVM values have proven less \\naccurate for these properties.

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower’s request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis.\\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and  the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months  to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $115\\xa0million  at September\\xa030, 2023 . Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower’s interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower’s revolving charge privileges are revoked.\\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid \\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized \\ncost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in \\nthe disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost \\nbalances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is \\nexcluded.

These proceedings \\nand investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo \\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related \\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our \\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our \\nsubsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \\notherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \\nof investigations of other persons or industry groups. \\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \\nassociated with the actions become probable and the costs can \\nbe reasonably estimated.

Shareholders filed a \\nputative securities fraud class action against the Company and its \\nexecutive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions \\nof CPI-related information in the Company’s public disclosures. In \\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants \\nexcept the Company and a former executive officer and limited \\nthe action to two alleged misstatements. On September 26, \\n2023, the court granted final approval of an agreement pursuant \\nto which the Company paid $300 million  to resolve this action. \\nAdditionally, a number of other lawsuits were filed by non-\\ngovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies \\nrelated to these CPI policies and related to the unused portion of \\nguaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance \\nagreements. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into \\nvarious settlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others were \\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, \\nincluding the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, \\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues \\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer \\nauto loans, including related insurance products. On \\nDecember\\xa020, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the CFPB to resolve the CFPB’s investigations related to \\nautomobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage \\nlending. The consent order requires, among other things, remediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion  civil \\npenalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company \\nentered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state \\nattorneys general.\\nCOMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS   Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department \\nof Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \\nthe Company’s 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \\n401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \\nthe Company’s contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \\ndisclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \\nthe Department of Labor’s review. On September 26, 2022, \\nparticipants in the Company’s 401(k) plan filed a putative class \\naction in the United States District Court for the District of \\nMinnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \\ncertain of these transactions.\\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION   Wells Fargo \\nshareholders brought a putative securities fraud class action in \\nthe United States District Court for the Southern District of New \\nYork alleging that the Company and certain of its current and \\nformer executive officers and directors made false or misleading \\nstatements regarding the Company’s efforts to comply with the \\nFebruary 2018 consent order with the Federal Reserve Board and \\nthe April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB and OCC. On \\nSeptember 8, 2023, the court granted final approval of an \\nagreement pursuant to which the Company paid $1.0 billion  to \\nresolve this action. Allegations related to the Company’s efforts \\nto comply with these three consent orders are also among the \\nsubjects of shareholder derivative lawsuits filed in California state \\nand federal court.\\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS   Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the SEC, have \\nundertaken formal or informal inquiries or investigations \\nregarding the Company’s hiring practices related to diversity. The \\nUnited States Department of Justice has since closed its \\ninvestigation without taking action. A putative securities fraud \\nclass action has also been filed in the United States District Court \\nfor the Northern District of California alleging that the Company \\nand certain of its executive officers made false or misleading \\nstatements about the Company’s hiring practices related to \\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company’s hiring practices \\nrelated to diversity are also among the subjects of a shareholder \\nderivative lawsuit pending in the United States District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California.\\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION   Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \\nmerchants have filed individual actions, against Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \\nwith Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions.

Plaintiff merchants allege \\nthat Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \\ntying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \\nanticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \\ndefendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other \\nentities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \\nInterchange Litigation. On July\\xa013, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \\nconsolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \\n$6.6 billion  before reductions applicable to certain merchants \\nopting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \\ndefault interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants.\\xa0Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune\\xa030, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November\\xa023,\\xa02016, prior \\nclass counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, \\nseeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second \\nCircuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, \\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead \\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. \\nThe parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve \\nthe damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a \\ntotal of approximately $6.2 billion , which includes approximately \\n$5.3\\xa0billion  of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and \\n$900 million  in additional funding. The Company’s allocated \\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately \\n$94.5\\xa0million . The court granted final approval of the settlement \\non December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector \\nmerchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the \\ndamages class settlement. On September 27, 2021, the district \\ncourt granted the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in the \\nequitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action \\nlitigations have been settled while others remain pending.\\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS   The SEC and the United \\nStates Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have \\nundertaken investigations regarding the Company’s compliance \\nwith records retention requirements relating to business \\ncommunications sent over unapproved electronic messaging \\nchannels. In August 2023, the Company entered into agreements \\npursuant to which it paid $125 million  to the SEC and $75 million  \\nto the CFTC in order to resolve their investigations.RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION   In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \\nand Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \\ncourt. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \\ncauses of action based upon, among other things, the trustee’s \\nalleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of \\nmortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \\nand warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \\nabide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \\nof default. In July\\xa02022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \\nLight’s claims and certain of the claims asserted by \\nCommerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \\ncase in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix \\nLight and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court’s \\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \\nCircuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, \\nterminating its case. In October 2023, the Company reached an \\nagreement in principle with IKB to resolve IKB’s claims. The \\nCompany previously settled two  class actions filed by \\ninstitutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit \\nUnion Administration with similar allegations.\\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION   The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells\\xa0Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor’s trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three  individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case.\\nOUTLOOK   As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company’s accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.6 billion  as of \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 . The outcomes of legal actions are \\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is \\ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \\neven possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \\namount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \\nprobable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \\nAccordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \\ninformation currently available, advice of counsel, available \\ninsurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \\nbelieves that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \\nFargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo’s \\nconsolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \\nultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \\nto Wells Fargo’s results of operations for any particular period.Note 10 :\\xa0 Legal Actions  (continued)\\n96 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote\\xa01 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges  \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert \\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of \\ndeposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nrisk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure \\nto foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the \\nissuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use \\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against \\nchanges in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale \\n(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign \\ncurrency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest \\nrate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated \\namounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain \\nfair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of \\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency \\nbasis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20  (Other Comprehensive Income ) for the \\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in \\ninterest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated \\nlong-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\\nWe estimate $976 million  pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at September\\xa030, 2023 , will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths. For cash flow hedges as of September\\xa030, 2023 , we are \\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the \\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for \\na maximum of 9 years .

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include:\\n• underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities;\\n• providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees;\\n• entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;\\n• holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;\\n• acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n• providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and\\n• providing seller financing to VIEs.\\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity\\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage \\nloans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are \\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, \\nwhich provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \\nservicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \\npools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \\n(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \\nVeterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \\nGSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, \\nsponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \\nmost significant to the VIE.\\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \\nto repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \\nthree scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \\nunilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \\na corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to \\nthe securitization. At September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, \\n2022 , we recorded assets and related liabilities of $1.1\\xa0billion  and \\n$743\\xa0million , respectively, where we did not exercise our option \\nto repurchase eligible loans. We repurchased loans of $49\\xa0million  \\nand $240 million , during the third quarter  and first nine months \\nof 2023 , respectively, and $574\\xa0million  and $2.1 billion  during \\nthe third quarter  and first nine months of 2022 , respectively.\\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, 2022 , \\nour liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was \\n$185\\xa0million  and $167\\xa0million , respectively, and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $13.5 billion  and $13.8 billion  at \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023  and December\\xa031, 2022 , respectively. \\n Substantially all  residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to  GSE and GNMA securitizations . See Note 6  \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities ) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS   In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \\nloans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \\nNonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest \\nholders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \\nthe securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \\nloans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \\nretain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \\ninterests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \\ninvestment purposes. Our servicing role related to \\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is \\nlimited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \\nVIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \\nor the controlling class security holder. For our residential \\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as \\nsales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider \\npotentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a \\nmajority of the VIE assets.\\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS  We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs.\\nTable 13.1  presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2.

The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and \\nworkout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore \\nwe do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs.\\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES \\xa0 We engage in various forms of \\nstructured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including \\nasset-backed finance structures and other securitizations \\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral \\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student \\nloans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or \\nmarketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service \\none or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives \\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We \\nare not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we do not have power to direct the most significant activities of the \\nVIEs.\\nTable 13.4  provides a summary of our exposure to the \\nunconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes \\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity \\nagreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude \\ncertain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our \\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature \\nor insignificant in size.\\nIn Table 13.4 , “Total VIE assets” represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the \\nmost current information available. “Carrying value” is the \\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our \\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. “Maximum exposure \\nto loss” is determined as the carrying value of our investment in \\nthe VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that \\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity \\nand lending commitments, the notional amount of net written \\nderivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or \\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and \\ncertain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, \\nsold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n“Maximum exposure to loss” represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for \\nwhich we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset \\nfrom any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an \\nindication of expected loss.Note 13 :  Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities  (continued)\\n116 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Where legally \\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \\nsame counterparty. Collateralized financings, and those with a \\nsingle counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit \\nbalance sheet netting. The majority of  transactions subject to \\nthese agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not \\neligible for balance sheet netting.\\nWells Fargo & Company 121', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1)\\xa0the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily  consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \\namounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

For additional information, see \\nNote\\xa01 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).\\nExpenses\\nOPERATING LOSSES   Operating losses consist of expenses related \\nto: \\n• Legal actions such as litigation and regulatory matters. For \\nadditional information on legal actions, see Note 10  (Legal \\nActions ); \\n• Customer remediation activities, which are associated with \\nour efforts to identify areas or instances where customers \\nmay have experienced financial harm and provide \\nremediation as appropriate. We have accrued for the \\nprobable and estimable costs related to our customer \\nremediation activities, which amounts may change based on \\nadditional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews \\nand communications with our regulators; and\\n• Other business activities such as deposit overdraft losses, \\nfraud losses, and isolated instances of customer redress.\\nTable 17.2  provides the components of our operating losses \\nincluded in our consolidated  statement of income.  \\nTable 17.2:   Operating Losses  \\nQuarter ended \\nSeptember 30,Nine months ended \\nSeptember 30,\\n($ in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\\nLegal actions $ 175  984 $ 115  1,097 \\nCustomer remediation  (30)  978  133  1,615 \\nOther  184  256  580  755 \\nTotal operating losses $ 329  2,218 $ 828  3,467 \\nOperating losses may have significant variability given the \\ninherent and unpredictable nature of legal actions and customer \\nremediation activities. The timing and determination of the \\namount of any associated losses for these matters depends on a \\nvariety of factors, some of which are outside of our control. OTHER EXPENSES  Regulatory Charges and Assessments expense, \\nwhich is included in other noninterest expense, was $277\\xa0million  \\nand $849 million  in the third quarter and first nine months of \\n2023 , respectively, compared with $207 million  and $640 million  \\nin the same periods a year ago, and primarily consisted of Federal \\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) deposit assessment \\nexpense.\\nIn May 2023, the FDIC proposed a rule to recover by special \\nassessment losses to the FDIC deposit insurance fund as a result \\nof bank failures in the first half of 2023. Under the proposed rule, \\nthe FDIC would collect a special assessment based on a \\ncalculation using an insured depository institution’s estimated \\namount of uninsured deposits. As currently proposed, the \\namount of our special assessment may be up to $1.8 billion  (pre-\\ntax). We expect to expense the entire amount upon the FDIC’s \\nfinalization of the rule, which we expect to occur in fourth quarter \\n2023. The proposed rule may be changed prior to finalization and \\nany changes may affect the timing or amount of the special \\nassessment.Note 17 :  Revenue and Expenses  (continued)\\n128 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",
