The \\\\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\\\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\\\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\\\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\\\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\\\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\\\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\\\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\\\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\\\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\\\nconsistently across the operating segments.\\\\nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \\\\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\\\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics.

Effective January\\\\xa01, 2023, \\\\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\\\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\\\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\\\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\\\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\\\na reportable operating segment’s use of capital.\\\\nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\\\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\\\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\\\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\\\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\\\noperating segments or lines of business.\\\\nTable 5:   Management Reporting Structure\\\\nWells Fargo & Company\\\\nConsumer \\\\nBanking and \\\\nLendingCommercial \\\\nBankingCorporate and \\\\nInvestment \\\\nBankingWealth and \\\\nInvestment \\\\nManagementCorporate\\\\n• Consumer, Small \\\\nand Business \\\\nBanking\\\\n• Home Lending\\\\n• Credit Card\\\\n• Auto\\\\n• Personal Lending• Middle Market \\\\nBanking\\\\n• Asset-Based \\\\nLending and Leasing• Banking\\\\n• Commercial Real \\\\nEstate\\\\n• Markets• Wells Fargo \\\\nAdvisors\\\\n• The Private\\\\nBank• Corporate \\\\nTreasury\\\\n• Enterprise \\\\nFunctions\\\\n• Investment \\\\nPortfolio\\\\n• Venture capital \\\\nand private equity \\\\ninvestments\\\\n• Non-strategic \\\\nbusinessesEarnings Performance  (continued)\\\\n12 Wells Fargo & Company', 'Note 16: Operating Segments \\\\nOur management reporting is organized into four reportable \\\\noperating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; \\\\nCommercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and \\\\nWealth and Investment Management.

The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nTable 5: Management Reporting Structure When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit).

Our U.S. workforce was 53% Caucasian/white and 47% \\nracially/ethnically diverse. \\nEmployee learning and development. We invest in the \\ndevelopment of our employees and managers. We believe that \\nwhen our employees feel properly supported, engaged, and \\nconfident in their skills, they are more effective and can provide \\nan even better customer experience. During 2023, we invested \\napproximately $200 million in a variety of employee learning and \\ndevelopment programs, including functional training, regulatory \\ncompliance, leadership and professional development, and early \\ntalent development programs. In addition, we provided tuition \\nreimbursement for approximately 2,600 employees in 2023. \\nWork-life programs. Wells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, \\nand work arrangements intended to provide employees with \\nflexibility and work-life balance. For example, employees in \\ncertain non-customer-facing roles have flexibility to work up to \\ntwo days a week remotely, and are expected to spend a minimum \\nof three days a week in the office. Expectations for other roles, \\nincluding customer-facing, operations, contact center, and non-\\nU.S. based employees, vary by business need. \\nCompetition The financial services industry is highly competitive.

      "Wells Fargo, as a bank holding company, is subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act (BHC Act) and is inspected, examined, and supervised by the Federal Reserve Board (FRB). The company's subsidiary national banks, as well as their subsidiaries, are also subject to regulation and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Non-U.S. branches and representative offices of Wells Fargo's subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB.

      "The regulatory framework applicable to Wells Fargo is intended to protect depositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers, and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as Wells Fargo. The regulatory framework could restrict the company's ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, and pay dividends on its capital stock. It may also require the company to provide financial support to one or more of its subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial condition of depository institutions. The impact of these regulatory requirements on Wells Fargo's business operations could be material.\n",

The \\nstandards relate generally to operations and management, asset \\nquality, interest rate exposure, executive compensation and risk \\nmanagement. Federal banking regulators are authorized to take \\naction against institutions that fail to meet such standards. \\nThe FDI Act requires federal banking regulators to take \\n“prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured \\ndepository institutions that do not meet minimum capital \\nrequirements. A depository institution’s treatment for purposes \\nof the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how \\nits capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain \\nother factors, as established by regulation. \\nIn addition, the FRB’s capital plan rule establishes capital \\nplanning and other requirements that govern capital \\ndistributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by \\ncertain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. Federal banking regulators \\nalso require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has \\n4', 'sufficient capital to continue to operate during periods of \\nadverse economic and financial conditions. \\nFor more information on our capital requirements and \\nplanning, see the “Capital Management” section of the 2023 \\nAnnual Report to Shareholders. \\nDeposit Insurance Assessments \\nThe Company’s subsidiaries include banks, such as Wells Fargo \\nBank, N.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Through the Deposit \\nInsurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC, the FDIC insures \\nthe deposits of our insured banks up to prescribed limits for each \\ndepositor and funds the DIF through assessments on member \\nbanks. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an \\ninsurance premium based on an assessment base and an \\nassessment rate. \\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for \\nDIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. For \\nmore information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, \\nsee Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in \\nthe 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders. \\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit \\ninsurance upon a finding that the institution’s financial condition \\nis unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors have \\nengaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any \\napplicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed \\nby the institution’s regulatory agency. The termination of deposit \\ninsurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in \\na significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect \\non our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of \\nthe particular banks involved. \\nFiscal and Monetary Policies \\nOur business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal \\nand monetary policies of the federal government and its \\nagencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of \\nthe FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the \\nUnited States. Among the instruments of monetary policy \\navailable to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations \\nin United States government securities, (b) changing the \\ndiscount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) \\nimposing or changing reserve requirements against depository \\ninstitutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve \\nrequirements against certain borrowings by banks and their \\naffiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and \\ncombinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and \\ndeposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid \\non deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect \\non our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\nPrivacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and \\nRestrictions on Affiliate Marketing \\nFederal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-\\nBliley Act (GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of \\nbanks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic \\ninformation about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The \\nrules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in \\nsome circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of \\ncertain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The \\nprivacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer \\ninformation is transmitted through diversified financial services \\ncompanies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial \\nregulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate \\nCredit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the \\nlength of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are \\nprovided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of \\nmarketing products and services by those affiliated companies. \\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented \\na broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures \\ndesigned to increase corporate responsibility, provide for \\nenhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at \\npublicly traded companies, and protect investors by improving \\nthe accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities \\nlaws. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required \\nto file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/ \\nor its implementing regulations established membership \\nrequirements and additional responsibilities for our audit \\ncommittee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us \\nand our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of \\nnon-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed \\nadditional responsibilities for our external financial statements \\non our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded \\nthe disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required \\nour management to evaluate our disclosure controls and \\nprocedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and \\nrequired our independent registered public accounting firm to \\nissue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. \\nUSA PATRIOT Act \\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \\nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism \\nAct of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) is intended to strengthen the \\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence \\ncommunities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety \\nof fronts. The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for \\ndepository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses \\ninvolved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act requires \\nthe implementation of policies and procedures relating to \\nanti‑money laundering, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, \\nand currency transaction reporting and due diligence on \\ncustomers. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires federal banking \\nregulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in \\ncombating money laundering in determining whether to approve \\na proposed bank acquisition. \\nFuture Legislation or Regulation \\nEconomic, market and political conditions during the past several \\nyears have led to a significant amount of legislation and \\nregulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services \\nindustry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of \\nfinancial services companies from banking regulators. Further \\nlegislative changes and additional regulations may change our \\noperating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. \\nSuch legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing \\nbusiness, affect our compensation structure, restrict or expand \\nthe activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive \\nbalance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and \\nother financial institutions. We cannot predict whether future \\nlegislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect \\nthat they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our \\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition. \\n5']\n",

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5 . We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company’s \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments.\\nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics.

Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company’s \\nconsolidated financial results.\\nAllocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January\\xa01, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment’s use of capital.\\nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\noperating segments or lines of business.\\nTable 5:   Management Reporting Structure\\nWells Fargo & Company\\nConsumer \\nBanking and \\nLendingCommercial \\nBankingCorporate and \\nInvestment \\nBankingWealth and \\nInvestment \\nManagementCorporate\\n• Consumer, Small \\nand Business \\nBanking\\n• Home Lending\\n• Credit Card\\n• Auto\\n• Personal Lending• Middle Market \\nBanking\\n• Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing• Banking\\n• Commercial Real \\nEstate\\n• Markets• Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors\\n• The Private\\nBank• Corporate \\nTreasury\\n• Enterprise \\nFunctions\\n• Investment \\nPortfolio\\n• Venture capital \\nand private equity \\ninvestments\\n• Non-strategic \\nbusinessesEarnings Performance  (continued)\\n12 Wells Fargo & Company', 'Note 16: Operating Segments \\nOur management reporting is organized into four reportable \\noperating segments: Consumer Banking and Lending; \\nCommercial Banking; Corporate and Investment Banking; and \\nWealth and Investment Management.
