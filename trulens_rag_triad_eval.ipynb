We adopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and \\ncertain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the \\nCompany‚Äôs ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. \\n(3) Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and interest-earning deposits with banks. \\n(4) Book value per common share is common stockholders‚Äô equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares \\noutstanding. \\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than \\nmortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible \\ncommon equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common \\nequity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company‚Äôs use of equity. For additional information, including a corresponding \\nreconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measures, see the ‚ÄúCapital Management ‚Äì Tangible Common Equity‚Äù section in this Report. \\n(6) Represents Wells Fargo net income divided by average assets. \\n(7) Represents Wells Fargo net income applicable to common stock divided by average common stockholders‚Äô equity. \\n(8) The efficiency ratio is noninterest expense divided by total revenue (net interest income and noninterest income). \\n(9) For additional information, see the ‚ÄúCapital Management‚Äù section and Note 21 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\n(10) Represents TLAC divided by RWAs, which is our binding TLAC ratio, determined by using the greater of RWAs under the Standardized and Advanced Approaches. \\n(11) Represents average high-quality liquid assets divided by average projected net cash outflows, as each is defined under the LCR rule. \\nWells Fargo & Company 2 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Wells Fargo ranked No. 41 on Fortune‚Äôs 2022 \\nrankings of America‚Äôs largest corporations. We ranked fourth in \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among \\nall U.S. banks at March 31, 2023. \\nWells Fargo‚Äôs top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business, \\noperations, products and services, and risk management \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience \\nissues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. \\nWe are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we \\nimplement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result \\nin additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others, and failure \\nto satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a timely \\nbasis could result in additional penalties, business restrictions, \\nenforcement actions, and other negative consequences, which \\ncould be significant. While we still have significant work to do and \\nhave not yet satisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, \\nthe Company is committed to devoting the resources necessary \\nto operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain \\nthe highest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in \\nplace. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company‚Äôs Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board‚Äôs governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the \\nCompany‚Äôs compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB‚Äôs acceptance and approval of the plans and the Company‚Äôs \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company‚Äôs total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company‚Äôs compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest \\nrate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the \\nCompany submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide \\ncompliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the \\nCompany‚Äôs internal audit program with respect to federal \\nconsumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In \\naddition, as required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers \\naffected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and \\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the \\nmanagement of remediation activities conducted by the \\nCompany. The Company continues to work to address the \\nprovisions of the consent orders.

The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nFactors‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our \\nongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our \\nrisk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the \\nfuture identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To \\nthe extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any \\ncustomer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have \\npreviously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding these activities, \\nincluding related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù \\nsection in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nRecent Developments \\nLIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is a widely \\nreferenced benchmark rate that seeks to estimate the cost at which banks can borrow on an unsecured basis from other banks. \\nOn March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom‚Äôs Financial Conduct \\nAuthority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator \\nof LIBOR, announced that certain settings of LIBOR would no \\nlonger be published on a representative basis after December 31, \\n2021, and the most commonly used U.S. dollar (USD) LIBOR \\nsettings would no longer be published on a representative basis \\nafter June 30, 2023. \\nIn first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \\nAct (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide \\na statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate \\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in U.S. \\nlaw contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have \\nfallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on \\nLIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act \\non December 16, 2022, which became effective on February 27, \\n2023. We expect that the LIBOR Act will transition certain of our \\nlegacy USD LIBOR contracts that do not have appropriate \\nfallback provisions to the applicable SOFR-based replacement \\nrates specified in the FRB‚Äôs final rule. \\nIn preparation for the cessation of USD LIBOR on a \\nrepresentative basis, we no longer offer new contracts \\nreferencing LIBOR, subject to limited exceptions based on \\nregulatory guidance. We also continue to execute our LIBOR \\ntransition activities to enhance our operational readiness. \\nFor certain contracts, including commercial credit facilities \\nand related derivatives, we continue to proactively engage with \\nour clients and contract parties to replace LIBOR with SOFR-\\nbased rates or other alternative reference rates in advance of the \\nJune 30, 2023 transition date. \\nFollowing June 30, 2023, we expect substantially all of our \\nconsumer loans, commercial credit facilities, debt securities, \\nderivatives, and long-term debt indexed to USD LIBOR to \\ntransition to SOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in \\naccordance with existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. \\nFor additional information regarding the risks and potential \\nimpact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being \\nsignificantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nFactors‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nFinancial Performance \\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12 \\nIn first quarter 2023, we adopted FASB ASU 2018-12 ‚Äì Financial \\nServices ‚Äì Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the \\nAccounting for Long-Duration Contracts . The most significant \\nimpact of adoption related to reinsurance of variable annuity \\nproducts for a limited number of our insurance clients. These \\nvariable annuity products contain guaranteed minimum benefits \\nthat require us to make benefit payments for the remainder of \\nthe policyholder‚Äôs life once the policyholder's account values are \\nexhausted. Our reinsurance business is no longer entering into \\nnew contracts. The ASU requires these guaranteed minimum \\nbenefits (referred to as market risk benefits) to be measured at \\nfair value through earnings (recognized in other noninterest \\nincome), except for changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk, which are recognized in other comprehensive income. \\nWe adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \\nrequired revision of prior period financial statements. Prior \\nperiod risk-based capital and certain other regulatory related \\nmetrics were not revised.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5. We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company‚Äôs \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nTable 5: Management Reporting Structure When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company‚Äôs \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January 1, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment‚Äôs use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results.

Our off-balance sheet arrangements \\ninclude unfunded credit commitments, transactions with \\nunconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. \\nThese transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs \\nof customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, \\nand/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nUnfunded Credit Commitments \\nUnfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to \\nlend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, \\ncontractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required \\ncollateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these \\ncommitments may expire without being used or may be \\ncancelled at the customer‚Äôs request. Our credit risk monitoring \\nactivities include managing the amount of commitments, both to \\nindividual customers and in total, and the size and maturity \\nstructure of these commitments. For additional information, see \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of \\non- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose \\nentities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability \\ncompanies or partnerships that are established for a limited \\npurpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with \\nsecuritization transactions and are considered variable interest \\nentities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make \\npayments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in \\nan underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are \\ngenerally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, \\nwritten options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing \\nhouse guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar \\narrangements. For additional information, see Note 14 \\n(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \\nin this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale \\nagreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities to provide capital for customers‚Äô \\nfunding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional \\ninformation, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \\nassist customers with their risk management objectives. \\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at \\nfair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional \\namount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the \\nbasis on which interest and other payments are determined. The \\nnotional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance \\nsheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure \\nof the risk profile of the instruments.

The \\ndiscussion that follows supplements our discussion of the \\nmanagement of certain risks contained in the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCredit Risk Management \\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a \\nborrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in \\naccordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many \\nof the Company‚Äôs assets and exposures such as debt security \\nholdings, certain derivatives, and loans. \\nThe Board‚Äôs Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk \\nCommittee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of \\ncredit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, \\nwhich is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the \\nChief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit \\nrisk provided to the Board‚Äôs Risk Committee or its Credit \\nSubcommittee. \\nLoan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest \\ncomponent of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which \\nwe have credit risk.

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate \\nconsiderations into its credit risk management activities. \\nOur credit risk management oversight process is governed \\ncentrally, but provides for direct management and accountability \\nby our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes \\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, \\nfrequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive \\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit \\nprocess. \\nA key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-\\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate \\nfor the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase \\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the loans. \\nCredit Quality Overview Table 11 provides credit quality trends . \\nTable 11: Credit Quality Overview \\n($ in millions) Mar 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nNonaccrual loans \\nCommercial loans $ 2,275 1,823 \\nConsumer loans 3,735 3,803 \\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 6,010 5,626 \\nNonaccrual loans as a % of total loans 0.63 % 0.59 \\nAllowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans $ 13,705 13,609 \\nACL for loans as a % of total loans 1.45 % 1.42 \\nMar 31, 2023 Mar 31, 2022 \\nNet loan charge-offs as a % of: \\nAverage commercial loans 0.05% (0.02) \\nAverage consumer loans 0.56 0.35 \\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios and our credit \\nquality trends follows. \\nSignificant Loan Portfolio Reviews Our credit risk monitoring \\nprocess is designed to enable early identification of developing \\nrisk and to support our determination of an appropriate \\nallowance for credit losses.

The \\ntotal CRE loan portfolio decreased $1.1 billion from \\nDecember 31, 2022, primarily driven by a decrease in loans for \\nmixed use properties and office property types, partially offset \\nby an increase in loans for the apartments property type. The \\nportfolio is diversified both geographically and by property type. \\nThe largest geographic concentrations of CRE loans are in \\nCalifornia, New York, Texas, and Florida, which represented a \\ncombined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The largest property \\ntype concentrations are apartments at 26% and office at 23% of \\nthe portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments were $9.2 billion \\nand $8.8 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, \\nrespectively, for CRE mortgage loans and $18.9 billion and $20.7 \\nbillion, respectively, for CRE construction loans. \\nWe generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment \\nusing our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had \\nTable 13: CRE Loans by State and Property Type $13.2 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at \\nMarch 31, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at December 31, \\n2022, and $1.3 billion of CRE construction loans classified as \\ncriticized at March 31, 2023, compared with $1.1 billion at \\nDecember 31, 2022. The increase in criticized CRE loans was \\npredominantly driven by the office property type. The credit \\nquality of the office property type continued to be adversely \\naffected as weakened demand for office space continued to drive \\nhigher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance. \\nAt March 31, 2023, nearly one-third of the CRE loans in the \\noffice property type had recourse to a guarantor, typically \\nthrough a repayment guarantee, in addition to the related \\ncollateral. Loans in California and New York represented \\napproximately 40% of the office property type at March 31, \\n2023. \\nTable 13 provides our CRE loans by state and property type. \\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 \\nReal estate mortgage Real estate construction Total commercial real estate Total commercial real estate \\nLoans \\nLoans Loans Loans as % of Total Loans Total \\nNonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding total commitments outstanding commitments \\n($ in millions) loans balance loans balance loans balance loans (1) balance (1) \\nBy state: \\nCalifornia $ 313 28,898 1 4,550 314 33,448 4% $ 38,524 34,285 39,594 \\nNew York 133 14,585 ‚Äî 2,433 133 17,018 2 19,375 17,294 19,360 \\nTexas 21 11,672 ‚Äî 1,288 21 12,960 1 14,952 12,807 14,941 \\nFlorida 9 9,693 ‚Äî 1,850 9 11,543 1 14,531 11,418 14,690 \\nNorth Carolina 6 4,123 ‚Äî 1,064 6 5,187 * 6,826 5,227 6,650 \\nWashington 86 4,247 ‚Äî 1,437 86 5,684 * 6,745 5,603 6,868 \\nGeorgia 116 4,594 ‚Äî 819 116 5,413 * 6,616 5,428 6,651 \\nArizona 13 4,730 ‚Äî 601 13 5,331 * 6,254 5,302 6,288 \\nNew Jersey 7 2,727 ‚Äî 1,480 7 4,207 * 5,519 4,119 5,660 \\nMassachusetts 4 2,728 42 1,105 46 3,833 * 5,070 4,094 5,324 \\nOther (2) 698 42,532 1 7,551 699 50,083 5 58,407 50,225 59,294 \\nTotal $ 1,406 130,529 44 24,178 1,450 154,707 16% $ 182,819 155,802 185,320 \\nBy property: \\nApartments $ 8 30,636 ‚Äî 9,396 8 40,032 4% $ 51,266 39,743 51,567 \\nOffice 725 31,788 ‚Äî 3,883 725 35,671 4 39,867 36,144 40,827 \\nIndustrial/warehouse 36 16,914 ‚Äî 3,573 36 20,487 2 24,415 20,634 24,546 \\nHotel/motel 151 11,464 ‚Äî 1,337 151 12,801 1 13,889 12,751 13,758 \\nRetail (excl shopping center) 198 11,478 2 122 200 11,600 1 12,310 11,753 12,486 \\nShopping center 197 8,957 ‚Äî 418 197 9,375 * 10,003 9,534 10,131 \\nInstitutional 31 5,350 ‚Äî 2,341 31 7,691 * 9,027 7,725 9,178 \\nMixed use properties 45 4,453 42 943 87 5,396 * 6,555 5,887 7,139 \\nCollateral pool ‚Äî 3,078 ‚Äî 41 ‚Äî 3,119 * 3,477 3,062 3,662 \\n1-4 family structure ‚Äî 7 ‚Äî 1,242 ‚Äî 1,249 * 3,325 1,324 3,589 \\nOther 15 6,404 ‚Äî 882 15 7,286 * 8,685 7,245 8,437 \\nTotal $ 1,406 130,529 44 24,178 1,450 154,707 16 % $ 182,819 155,802 185,320 \\n* Less than 1%. \\n(1) Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit.

We establish exposure \\nlimits for each country through a centralized oversight process \\nbased on customer needs, and through consideration of the \\nrelevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures \\nclosely and adjust our country limits in response to changing \\nconditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure \\nbased on our assessment of a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay, \\nwhich gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as \\nguarantees and collateral, and may be different from the \\nreporting based on a borrower‚Äôs primary address. \\nOur largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at \\nMarch 31, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled \\nTable 14: Select Country Exposures $30.5 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and \\nincluded $4.6 billion of sovereign claims.

The entire allowance \\nis available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. \\nThe ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing \\nfactors as of the date of determination, including economic or \\nmarket conditions and ongoing internal and external examination \\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes \\nin the economic and business environment, it is possible that we \\nwill incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the \\nbalance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is \\ndiscussed in the ‚ÄúCritical Accounting Policies ‚Äì Allowance for \\nCredit Losses‚Äù section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with \\nour sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we \\nhave established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information \\non our repurchase liability, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Credit \\nRisk Management ‚Äì Mortgage Banking Activities‚Äù section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \\nmortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage \\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of \\nFHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label \\nmortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans \\nowned by institutional investors. \\nAs a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent \\npayments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. \\nThe amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of \\ndelinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable \\nservicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer \\nadvances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans \\nfrom GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes \\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid \\nby the borrower. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as \\na result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \\nRepurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise \\nmodified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may \\nbe included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At \\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, these loans, which we \\nhave repurchased or have the option to repurchase, were \\n$9.3 billion and $9.8 billion, respectively, which included \\n$8.3 billion and $8.6 billion, respectively, in loans held for \\ninvestment, with the remainder in loans held for sale. See \\nNote 13 (Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout our involvement with mortgage loan securitizations. \\nFor additional information about the risks related to our \\nservicing activities, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Credit Risk \\nManagement ‚Äì Mortgage Banking Activities‚Äù section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking \\nactivities, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Asset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and \\nmanaging interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For \\ninformation on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management‚Äù section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \\ncan cause a loss of the Company‚Äôs earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the Company‚Äôs asset and liability cash flows \\nprimarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending \\nand deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: \\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest \\nrates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by \\ndifferent amounts; \\n‚Ä¢ short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nby different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield \\ncurve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs \\ndifferently; \\n‚Ä¢ the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if \\nlong-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, \\nmortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate \\nthan anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n‚Ä¢ interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan \\ndemand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage \\norigination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other \\nfinancial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the \\ndegree of change over time, the speed of change and the \\nprojected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require \\nassumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet \\ncomposition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans \\nand debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing \\nstrategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months \\nusing instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both \\nlower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. \\nSteeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in \\nthe yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors \\nthree years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as \\nall tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar \\ninterest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the \\nsimulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24: \\n‚Ä¢ Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to \\nour assets and liabilities. \\n‚Ä¢ Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n‚Ä¢ Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates. \\nWells Fargo & Company 37 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Deposit \\nmix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the \\nalternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, \\ncustomer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher \\nyielding products could impact expected net interest \\nincome. \\n‚Ä¢ The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the \\nhistorical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the \\nexpectations of deposit products repricing as market \\ninterest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our \\nactual experience in base and alternative scenarios may \\ndiffer from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of \\ndeposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other \\nfactors. \\n‚Ä¢ We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities \\nportfolios constant across scenarios. \\nTable 24: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \\nUsing Instantaneous Movements \\n($ in billions) Mar 31, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nParallel shift: \\n+100 bps shift in interest rates $ 2.1 2.3 \\n-100 bps shift in interest rates (2.1) (1.7) \\nSteeper yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 1.0 0.8 \\n-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.2) (1.0) \\nFlatter yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates 1.1 1.5 \\n-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (0.9) (0.7) \\nThe changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember 31, 2022, to March 31, 2023, in Table 24 reflected \\nupdates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance \\nsheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate \\nsensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher \\ninterest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater \\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest \\nrates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree \\nthan our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive \\nnoninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage \\nbanking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in \\nthe opposite direction of our net interest income. See the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì Mortgage Banking \\nInterest Rate and Market Risk‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K \\nfor additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\non commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \\ninformation on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage \\nour interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers \\nthe amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes \\nunrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt \\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized \\ninto earnings over the life of the security with no further impact \\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We \\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in the following \\nmain ways: \\n‚Ä¢ to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning \\ndeposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from \\nfloating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice \\nversa; \\n‚Ä¢ to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities \\nportfolio; and \\n‚Ä¢ to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, \\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 14 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate ‚Äúlocks‚Äù) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \\nthe ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì \\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk‚Äù section and \\nNote 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 11 (Derivatives), and \\nNote 12 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \\nStatements in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \\nrates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \\nbasis risk, and market liquidity risk.

These trading activities \\npredominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \\nextent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \\nfor trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and \\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \\nfinancial instruments used in our trading activities include net \\ninterest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and \\nlosses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \\nreflected in the interest income and interest expense \\ncomponents of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \\nin fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \\nadditional information on the financial instruments used in our \\ntrading activities and the income from these trading activities, \\nTable 25: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \\nmarkets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \\nsensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \\nmonitoring market risk. For additional information on our \\nmonitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see \\nthe ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì Market \\nRisk ‚Äì Trading Activities‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company‚Äôs trading positions. The \\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \\nto establish line of business and Company-wide risk limits. \\nTrading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 25 shows the Company‚Äôs Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR \\nfor the quarter ended March 31, 2023, compared with the same \\nperiod a year ago, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio \\ncomposition. \\nQuarter ended \\nMarch 31, 2023 December 31, 2022 March 31, 2022 \\nPeriod Period Period \\n(in millions) end Average Low High end Average Low High end Average Low High \\nCompany Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit 34 27 20 37 29 37 27 85 33 28 20 35 \\nInterest rate 40 32 19 48 25 35 20 88 26 15 9 30 \\nEquity 24 24 19 31 27 25 20 30 26 21 13 28 \\nCommodity 3 4 3 8 4 5 4 8 6 5 2 20 \\nForeign exchange 0 1 0 3 1 1 1 2 1 1 0 1 \\nDiversification benefit (1) (67) (49) (47) (60) (63) (43) \\nCompany Trading General VaR $ 34 39 39 43 29 27 \\n(1) The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly \\ncorrelated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may \\noccur on different days. \\nMARKET RISK ‚Äì EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \\naffected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage \\ndirect investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth \\ncompanies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate \\nrecapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that \\nmake similar private equity investments. For additional \\ninformation, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability \\nManagement ‚Äì Market Risk ‚Äì Equity Securities‚Äù section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nWe also have marketable equity securities that include \\ninvestments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair \\nvalue changes in these marketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 \\n(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \\nmanagement and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \\nto repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \\nother business activities. Each business line monitors and \\nmanages these indirect risks. \\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they \\ncome due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without incurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to ensure that we can meet our contractual \\nobligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both \\nnormal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-\\nspecific and/or market stress. \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \\nmonitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \\nCorporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \\nthe Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \\nboth the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \\nthe Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries.

The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells Fargo. \\nThe FRB, OCC and FDIC have also issued a rule implementing \\na stable funding requirement, known as the net stable funding \\nratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking organization, such \\nTable 26: Liquidity Coverage Ratio as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum amount of stable funding, \\nincluding common equity, long-term debt and most types of \\ndeposits, in relation to its assets, derivative exposures and \\ncommitments over a one-year horizon period.

We primarily fund our capital needs through the \\nretention of earnings net of both dividends and share \\nrepurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock \\nand long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at March 31, \\n2023, increased $3.7 billion from December 31, 2022, \\npredominantly as a result of $5.0 billion of Wells Fargo net \\nincome, partially offset by $1.4 billion of common and preferred \\nstock dividends. During first quarter 2023, we issued \\n$676 million of common stock, substantially all of which was \\nissued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. \\nIn first quarter 2023, we repurchased 86 million shares of \\ncommon stock at a cost of $4.0 billion. In first quarter 2023, our \\nAOCI increased $789 million, predominantly due to a decrease in \\nnet unrealized losses on AFS debt securities and derivative and \\nhedging activities. For additional information about capital \\nplanning, see the ‚ÄúCapital Planning and Stress Testing‚Äù section \\nbelow. \\nRegulatory Capital Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \\nregulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \\nratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \\nimplement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \\norganizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches.

Because the stress \\ncapital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ \\nover time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are \\nsubject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for \\nthe period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is \\n3.20%. \\nAs a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also \\nsubject to the FRB‚Äôs rule implementing an additional capital \\nsurcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio \\nrequirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually \\ncalculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \\nof the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \\nour size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \\nsubstitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \\nmethodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \\nBoard (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \\ninputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \\nTable 33: Capital Components and Ratios wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \\nthan under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \\ncalculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \\namount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \\nour annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \\nannual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our \\nG-SIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance \\nsheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories \\naccording to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the \\nnature of any collateral.

Under the Advanced Approach, eligible credit reserves represented by the amount of \\nqualifying ACL in excess of expected credit losses (using regulatory definitions) is limited to 0.60% of Advanced credit RWAs, whereas the Standardized Approach includes ACL in Tier 2 capital up to \\n1.25% of Standardized credit RWAs.

As of March 31, 2023, these broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \\nminimum net capital requirements. \\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing \\nOur planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \\nregulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \\nour business, satisfy our customers‚Äô financial needs in varying \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. We submitted our 2023 \\ncapital plan to the FRB prior to the April 5, 2023, deadline. \\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test.

Although we announce \\nwhen the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not \\ngive any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various \\nfactors determine the amount of our share repurchases, \\nincluding our capital requirements, the number of shares we \\nexpect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, \\nmarket conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and \\nregulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB‚Äôs \\ncapital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the \\nRegulatory Matters amount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be \\nin the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations \\nunder our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various \\nprice levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any \\ntime. \\nAt March 31, 2023, we had remaining Board authority to \\nrepurchase approximately 164 million shares, subject to \\nregulatory and legal conditions.

The \\nUpdate requires a separate accounting \\npolicy election for each tax credit \\nprogram. For any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected, all investments within \\nthat program that meet eligibility \\ncriteria are required to apply the \\nproportional amortization method. The \\nUpdate also requires additional \\ndisclosures for any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected. The Update eliminates the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)-only scope limitation of the \\nproportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made \\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent \\naccounting method. Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at \\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. \\nThe amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are \\nrecorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified \\nretrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. \\nUpon adoption of the Update, we will disaggregate our tax credit investment portfolio into tax credit \\nprograms and make a separate accounting policy election as to whether to apply the proportional \\namortization method for each program. For any investments that will apply the proportional \\namortization method upon adoption of the Update, the cumulative effect of the difference between the \\ncurrent carrying value and the carrying value under the proportional amortization method will be \\nrecorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings, the period of which is dependent \\nupon which transition method is selected. \\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements. \\nOther Accounting Developments \\nThe following Update is applicable to us but is not expected to \\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements: \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2022-03 ‚Äì Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair \\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual \\nSale Restrictions \\nWells Fargo & Company 51 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Projections \\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in \\nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Wells Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. For discussion of our significant \\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were \\nno material changes to these policies in first quarter 2023. \\nTo prepare the financial statements in conformity with \\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on \\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for \\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the \\ndate of the financial statements, income and expenses during the \\nreporting period and the related disclosures. Although our \\nestimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect \\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual \\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, \\nwhich could materially affect our results of operations and \\nfinancial condition. Management has made significant estimates \\nin several areas, including: \\n‚Ä¢ allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \\n‚Ä¢ valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n‚Ä¢ valuations of financial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities)); \\n‚Ä¢ liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 10 (Legal \\nActions)); \\n‚Ä¢ income taxes; and \\n‚Ä¢ goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nThese unaudited interim financial statements reflect all \\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary \\nfor a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. \\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless \\notherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations \\nin the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the \\nresults that may be expected for the full year. The interim \\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction with our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \\nIn 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n‚Ä¢ Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging ‚Äì Portfolio Layer Method \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2018-12, Financial Services ‚Äì Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates \\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis. \\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans. \\nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \\nexpands an entity's ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \\nfor interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \\nassets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \\nWells Fargo & Company 61 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders‚Äô equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately $566 \\nmillion of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt securities \\nbeing recorded to other comprehensive income, net of deferred \\ntaxes. \\nSee Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities) for additional information about the Company's \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11 \\n(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships. \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 ‚Äì Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 ‚Äì Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder‚Äôs account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by \\n$176 million and $44 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2022. \\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income and consolidated balance sheet for the quarter ended \\nMarch 31, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022. These \\nadjustments are also reflected in our consolidated statement of \\nchanges in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows. \\nWells Fargo & Company 62 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The credit quality \\nindicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings \\nand delinquency status and are based on information as of our \\nfinancial statement date. \\nCREDIT RATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit \\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a \\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by \\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). \\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings \\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are \\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities \\nrated below investment grade, labeled as ‚Äúspeculative grade‚Äù by \\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher \\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt \\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit \\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management \\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major \\ncredit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated \\nby NRSROs at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined \\nto be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based \\non internal credit grades. \\nWells Fargo & Company 66 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

At \\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had $1.3 billion and \\n$1.8 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial \\nletters of credit.

We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a \\nrepresentative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide \\nfor the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or \\nletter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in \\nless than a week and would normally require default of both the \\ncustomer and another lender to expose us to loss. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized \\nin Table 5.4.

Revolving \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a \\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty. \\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores \\nare generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9 provides the outstanding balances of our \\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality \\nindicators. \\nLTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan‚Äôs outstanding \\nbalance to the property‚Äôs collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) \\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien \\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line \\nproducts) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade \\napproach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less \\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs \\nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV \\nor CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 78 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower‚Äôs request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis. \\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $161 million at March 31, 2023. \\nTable 5.15: Commercial Loan Modifications Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower‚Äôs interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower‚Äôs revolving charge privileges are revoked. \\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid \\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized \\ncost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in \\nthe disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost \\nbalances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is \\nexcluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for \\nadditional information on accrued interest receivable.

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). The \\nfollowing disclosures present TDR information for the periods \\nended December 31, 2022, and March 31, 2022. When, for \\neconomic or legal reasons related to a borrower‚Äôs financial \\ndifficulties, we grant a concession for other than an insignificant \\nperiod of time to a borrower that we would not otherwise \\nconsider, the related loan is classified as a TDR, the balance of \\nwhich totaled $9.2 billion at December 31, 2022. We do not \\nconsider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a \\nTDR. In addition, COVID-19-related modifications are generally \\nnot classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and \\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional information on the \\nTDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing \\nfinancial difficulty to make trial payments generally for a period \\nof three to four months, according to the terms of a planned \\npermanent modification, to determine if they can perform \\naccording to those terms. These arrangements represent trial \\nmodifications, which we classified and accounted for as TDRs \\nthrough December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU \\n2022-02. While loans are in trial payment programs, their original \\nterms are not considered modified and they continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. \\nCommitments to lend additional funds on loans whose \\nterms have been modified in a TDR amounted to $434 million at \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nTable 5.17 summarizes our TDR modifications by primary \\nmodification type and includes the financial effects of these \\nmodifications.

In addition, Wells Fargo and our \\nsubsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \\notherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \\nof investigations of other persons or industry groups. \\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \\nassociated with the actions become probable and the costs can \\nbe reasonably estimated.

Shareholders filed a \\nputative securities fraud class action against the Company and its \\nexecutive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions \\nof CPI-related information in the Company‚Äôs public disclosures. In \\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants \\nexcept the Company and a former executive officer and limited \\nthe action to two alleged misstatements. Subject to court \\napproval, the parties have entered into an agreement pursuant to \\nwhich the Company will pay $300 million to resolve this action. \\nAdditionally, a number of other lawsuits were filed by non-\\ngovernmental parties seeking damages or other remedies \\nrelated to these CPI policies and related to the unused portion of \\nguaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance \\nagreements. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into \\nvarious settlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others were \\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, \\nincluding the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, \\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues \\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer \\nauto loans, including related insurance products. On \\nDecember 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the CFPB to resolve the CFPB‚Äôs investigations related to \\nautomobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage \\nlending. The consent order requires, among other things, \\nremediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil \\npenalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company \\nentered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state \\nattorneys general. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department \\nof Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \\nthe Company‚Äôs 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \\n401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \\nthe Company‚Äôs contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \\ndisclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \\nthe Department of Labor‚Äôs review. On September 26, 2022, \\nparticipants in the Company‚Äôs 401(k) plan filed a putative class \\naction in the United States District Court for the District of \\nMinnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \\ncertain of these transactions. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo \\nshareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action \\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of \\nNew York alleging that the Company and certain of its current \\nand former executive officers and directors made false or \\nmisleading statements regarding the Company‚Äôs efforts to \\ncomply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal \\nReserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB \\nand OCC. Allegations related to the Company‚Äôs efforts to comply \\nwith these three consent orders are also among the subjects of a \\nshareholder derivative lawsuit filed in California state court. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the United States \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or \\ninformal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company‚Äôs \\nhiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud \\nclass action has also been filed in the United States District Court \\nfor the Northern District of California alleging that the Company \\nand certain of its executive officers made false or misleading \\nstatements about the Company‚Äôs hiring practices related to \\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company‚Äôs hiring practices \\nrelated to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder \\nderivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California and in California state court. \\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \\nmerchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \\nwith Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \\nMasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \\ncompanies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \\nactions have been consolidated in the United States District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \\non alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \\ndamages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \\nthat Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \\ntying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \\nanticompetitive. Wells Fargo and Wachovia, along with other \\ndefendants and entities, are parties to Loss and Judgment \\nSharing Agreements, which provide that they, along with other \\nentities, will share, based on a formula, in any losses from the \\nWells Fargo & Company 92 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \\nconsolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \\n$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \\nopting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \\ndefault interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior \\nclass counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, \\nseeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second \\nCircuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, \\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead \\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. \\nThe parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve \\nthe damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a \\ntotal of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately \\n$5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and \\n$900 million in additional funding. The Company‚Äôs allocated \\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately \\n$94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement \\non December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector \\nmerchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the \\ndamages class settlement. Settlement objector merchants filed a \\npetition for a rehearing by the Second Circuit en banc. On \\nSeptember 27, 2021, the district court granted the plaintiffs‚Äô \\nmotion for class certification in the equitable relief case. Several \\nof the opt-out and direct action litigations have been settled \\nwhile others remain pending. \\nOFAC RELATED INVESTIGATION The Company self-identified an \\nissue whereby certain foreign banks utilized a Wells Fargo \\nsoftware-based solution to conduct import/export trade-related \\nfinancing transactions with countries and entities prohibited by \\nthe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) of the United States \\nDepartment of the Treasury. We do not believe any funds related \\nto these transactions flowed through accounts at Wells Fargo as \\na result of the aforementioned conduct. The Company made \\nvoluntary self-disclosures to OFAC and cooperated with \\ninvestigations or inquiries arising out of this matter by federal \\ngovernment agencies. In March 2023, the Company entered into \\nagreements pursuant to which it agreed to pay $67.8 million to \\nthe Federal Reserve and $30 million to OFAC in order to resolve \\ntheir investigations. \\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS The United States Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity \\nFutures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations \\nregarding the Company‚Äôs compliance with records retention \\nrequirements relating to business communications sent over \\nunapproved electronic messaging channels. RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York and by IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank in New York state court. In each case, the \\nplaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused \\nlosses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action based \\nupon, among other things, the trustee‚Äôs alleged failure to notify \\nand enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for \\npurported breaches of representations and warranties, notify \\ninvestors of alleged events of default, and abide by appropriate \\nstandards of care following alleged events of default. In \\nJuly 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light‚Äôs claims and \\ncertain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and \\nsubsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and \\nCommerzbank AG appealed the district court‚Äôs decision to the \\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The \\nCompany previously settled two class actions filed by \\ninstitutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit \\nUnion Administration with similar allegations. In addition, Park \\nRoyal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC have filed substantially similar \\nlawsuits in New York state court alleging Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., \\nas trustee, failed to take appropriate actions upon learning of \\ndefective mortgage loan documentation. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor‚Äôs trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. \\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company‚Äôs accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.4 billion as of March 31, \\n2023. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and \\nsubject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \\ndetermine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \\ninherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \\nmay be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \\npossible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \\nmay be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \\nreasonably possible loss. Based on information currently \\navailable, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and \\nestablished reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual \\noutcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its \\nsubsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on Wells Fargo‚Äôs consolidated financial \\ncondition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a \\nmatter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo‚Äôs results \\nof operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 93 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert \\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of \\ndeposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nrisk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure \\nto foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the \\nissuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use \\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against \\nchanges in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale \\n(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign \\ncurrency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest \\nrate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated \\namounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain \\nfair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of \\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency \\nbasis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the \\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income. \\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to \\nchanges in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use \\ncross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments \\non fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due \\nto changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $693 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at March 31, 2023, will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths. For cash flow hedges as of March 31, 2023, we are \\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the \\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for \\na maximum of 9 years. For additional information on our \\naccounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTable 11.3 and Table 11.4 show the net gains (losses) related \\nto derivatives in cash flow and fair value hedging relationships, \\nrespectively. \\nWells Fargo & Company 95 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We generally use \\ncredit derivatives to assist customers with their risk \\nmanagement objectives by purchasing and selling credit \\nprotection on corporate debt obligations through the use of \\ncredit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help \\nmanage counterparty exposure. We would be required to \\nperform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of \\ndefault by the referenced obligors. Events of default include \\nevents such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of \\nprincipal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 11.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 11.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\nProtection sold ‚Äì \\nnon-investment \\n(in millions) Protection sold grade \\nMarch 31, 2023 \\nCredit default swaps $ 17,033 2,200 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,782 6,571 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 23,815 8,771 \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCredit default swaps $ 12,733 1,860 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,728 6,518 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 19,461 8,378 \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of \\nrecovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from \\ncollateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a \\nhigher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the \\ncredit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is \\ninvestment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify \\nthe credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit \\nderivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order \\nto achieve our desired credit risk profile.

These nonrecurring adjustments \\ntypically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \\n(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \\napplication of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis are presented in Table 12.4 in this Note. We provide in \\nTable 12.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \\nare not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \\ncarried at amortized cost. \\nSee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in \\nour 2022 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair \\nvalue. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for \\nassets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or \\nnonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \\nbased on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \\nlowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K for a \\ndetailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \\nconsider all available information, including observable market \\ndata, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \\nused. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nthe unobservable inputs to the instruments‚Äô fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \\nconsidered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \\nmeasure fair value.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include: \\n‚Ä¢ underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities; \\n‚Ä¢ providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n‚Ä¢ entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n‚Ä¢ providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored \\nentities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into \\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain \\ncredit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer \\nmortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to \\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines \\nwhich are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \\nor guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or \\nGNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA \\ndesign the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the \\ninvolved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant \\nto the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which \\nbecomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments \\nremain unpaid by the borrower. During the quarters ended \\nMarch 31, 2023 and 2022, we repurchased loans of $92 million \\nand $933 million, respectively, which primarily represented \\nrepurchases of government insured loans. We recorded assets \\nand related liabilities of $935 million and $743 million at \\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, where we \\ndid not exercise our option to repurchase eligible loans. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our \\nliability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was \\n$165 million and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $13.9 billion and $13.8 billion at March 31, \\n2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that \\nwe design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, \\nand accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit \\nrisk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We \\ntypically originate the transferred loans and account for the \\ntransfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the \\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, \\nsuch as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our \\nservicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage \\nloan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We \\ndo not consolidate the VIE because the most significant \\ndecisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally \\nmade by the special servicer or the controlling class security \\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold \\nvariable interests that we consider potentially significant or are \\nnot the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 13.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2. The majority of our transfers relate to \\nresidential mortgage securitizations with the GSEs or GNMA and \\ngenerally result in no gain or loss because the loans are measured \\nat fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, we may transfer \\ncertain government insured loans that we previously \\nWells Fargo & Company 109 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement.

During the quarters ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe transferred securities of $3.2 billion and $6.4 billion, \\nrespectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained securities of \\n$198 million and $738 million, respectively.

Table 13.3 excludes mortgage \\nloans in GSE or GNMA securitizations of $693.2 billion and \\n$704.5 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, \\nrespectively.

For additional information \\nabout these VIEs, see the ‚ÄúLoan Sales and Securitization Activity‚Äù \\nsection within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations also include commercial mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations sponsored by third parties where we did not \\noriginate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and \\ninvest in securities that could be potentially significant to the \\nVIE. \\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization \\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from \\nTable 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have \\npower over the activities most significant to the VIEs. \\nAdditionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the \\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these \\nVIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming \\nmortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the \\n‚ÄúLoan Sales and Securitization Activity‚Äù and ‚ÄúResecuritization \\nActivities‚Äù sections within this Note. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased \\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to \\nVIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire \\nsuch beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a \\ntransferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also \\nservice the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the \\nbonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and \\nworkout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore \\nwe do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of \\nstructured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including \\nasset-backed finance structures and other securitizations \\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral \\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student \\nloans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or \\nmarketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service \\none or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives \\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We \\nare not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we \\ndo not have power to direct the most significant activities of the \\nVIEs. Table 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the \\nunconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes \\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity \\nagreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude \\ncertain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our \\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature \\nor insignificant in size. \\nIn Table 13.4, ‚ÄúTotal VIE assets‚Äù represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the \\nmost current information available. ‚ÄúCarrying value‚Äù is the \\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our \\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. ‚ÄúMaximum exposure \\nto loss‚Äù is determined as the carrying value of our investment in \\nthe VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that \\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity \\nand lending commitments, the notional amount of net written \\nderivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or \\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and \\ncertain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, \\nsold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n‚ÄúMaximum exposure to loss‚Äù represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for \\nwhich we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset \\nfrom any economic hedges. Accordingly, this disclosure is not an \\nindication of expected loss. \\nWells Fargo & Company 111 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The \\nprojects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have \\nthe power over the VIE‚Äôs assets, therefore, we do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax \\ncredit VIEs was $18.6 billion and $18.7 billion at March 31, 2023, \\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. We also had loans to tax \\ncredit VIEs with a carrying value of $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion at \\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. \\nOur maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at \\nMarch 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $28.7 billion and \\n$28.0 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss \\nincluded total unfunded equity and lending commitments of \\n$8.2 billion and $7.3 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31, \\n2022, respectively. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other \\nCommitments) for additional information about commitments \\nto purchase equity securities. \\nOur affordable housing equity investments qualify for the \\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For additional \\ninformation on our LIHTC investments, see Note 16 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Consolidated VIEs \\nWe consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We \\nare the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: \\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may \\nsecuritize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust \\nentity. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the key \\ndecisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE \\nassets held by the master trust represent a majority of the total \\nVIE assets presented for this category in Table 13.5. In a separate \\ntransaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and \\nequity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to \\nspecific vendors and service the underlying collateral. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other VIEs are predominantly related to \\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are \\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the \\nissuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with \\nMTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which \\nprovides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the \\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued \\nto investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage \\nloans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the \\nunderlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities \\nissued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the \\noutstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the \\nrelated debt associated with such securitizations. \\nWells Fargo & Company 112 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $210 million and $157 million with related collateral of $1.5 billion and $1.3 billion \\nas of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. \\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \\nthat would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \\ncircumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in \\nTable 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could \\nuse to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \\nagreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \\nthe guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \\nthe credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \\ndetermined based on an external rating or an internal credit \\ngrade that is below investment grade. \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency \\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \\nderivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \\nThe fair value of written options represents our view of the \\nprobability that we will be required to perform under the \\ncontract. The fair value of these written options was a liability of \\n$150 million and $15 million at March 31, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value may be an asset \\nas a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The \\nmaximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these \\nderivative contracts. At March 31, 2023, the maximum exposure \\nto loss was $32.1 billion, with $29.8 billion expiring in three years \\nor less compared with $23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. See Note 11 (Derivatives) \\nfor additional information regarding written derivative contracts. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks \\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \\nconnection with payment and delivery disputes between the \\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We \\nestimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total \\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four \\nmonths, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back \\ntransaction. As of March 31, 2023, our potential maximum \\nexposure was approximately $757.6 billion, and related losses, \\nincluding those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. \\nGUARANTEES OF SUBSIDIARIES The Parent fully and \\nunconditionally guarantees the payment of principal, interest, \\nand any other amounts that may be due on securities that its \\n100% owned finance subsidiary, Wells Fargo Finance LLC, may \\nissue. These securities are not guaranteed by any other subsidiary \\nof the Parent. The guaranteed liabilities were $891 million and \\n$948 million at March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, \\nrespectively.

These activities are \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \\nactivities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \\nU.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \\nsecurities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \\nour commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 15.2 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \\nmaster securities lending agreements (MSLA).

Collateralized financings, and those with a \\nsingle counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit \\nbalance sheet netting. The majority of transactions subject to \\nthese agreements do not meet those criteria and thus are not \\neligible for balance sheet netting. \\nCollateral we pledged consists of non-cash instruments, \\nsuch as securities or loans, and is not netted on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet against the related liability.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \\nobligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction‚Äôs \\nmaturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \\namounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. We define our \\nreportable operating segments by type of product and customer \\nsegment, and their results are based on our management \\nreporting process. The management reporting process measures \\nthe performance of the reportable operating segments based on \\nthe Company‚Äôs management structure, and the results are \\nregularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant \\nsenior management. The management reporting process is \\nbased on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as \\nfunds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared \\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial \\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with \\nannual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products \\nand services include checking and savings accounts, credit and \\ndebit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business \\nlending. \\nCommercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, \\nfamily owned and certain public companies. Products and \\nservices include banking and credit products across multiple \\nindustry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease \\nproducts, and treasury management. \\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital \\nmarkets, banking, and financial products and services to \\ncorporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional \\nclients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, \\ninvestment banking, treasury management, commercial real \\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as \\nwell as sales, trading, and research capabilities. \\nWealth and Investment Management provides personalized \\nwealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, \\nprivate banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to \\naffluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We \\noperate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth \\noffices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and \\ndigitally through WellsTrade ¬Æ and Intuitive Investor ¬Æ. Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, \\nnet of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, \\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable \\noperating segments as well as our investment portfolio and \\naffiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. \\nCorporate also includes certain lines of business that \\nmanagement has determined are no longer consistent with the \\nlong-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for \\npreviously divested businesses. \\nBasis of Presentation \\nFUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nREVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit).

Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts . We adopted ASU 2018-12 with retrospective application, which required revision of prior period financial statements. Prior period risk-based capital and \\ncertain other regulatory related metrics were not revised. For additional information, including the financial statement line items impacted by the adoption of ASU 2018-12, see Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\n(2) Pre-tax pre-provision profit (PTPP) is total revenue less noninterest expense. Management believes that PTPP is a useful financial measure because it enables investors and others to assess the \\nCompany‚Äôs ability to generate capital to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. \\n(3) Includes provision for credit losses for loans, debt securities, and interest-earning deposits with banks. \\n(4) Book value per common share is common stockholders‚Äô equity divided by common shares outstanding. Tangible book value per common share is tangible common equity divided by common shares \\noutstanding. \\n(5) Tangible common equity is a non-GAAP financial measure and represents total equity less preferred equity, noncontrolling interests, goodwill, certain identifiable intangible assets (other than \\nmortgage servicing rights) and goodwill and other intangibles on investments in consolidated portfolio companies, net of applicable deferred taxes. The methodology of determining tangible \\ncommon equity may differ among companies. Management believes that return on average tangible common equity and tangible book value per common share, which utilize tangible common \\nequity, are useful financial measures because they enable management, investors, and others to assess the Company‚Äôs use of equity.

Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune‚Äôs 2023 \\nrankings of America‚Äôs largest corporations. We ranked fourth in \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among \\nall U.S. banks at June 30, 2023. \\nWells Fargo‚Äôs top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business, \\noperations, products and services, and risk management \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience \\nissues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. \\nWe are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we \\nimplement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result \\nin additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others, and \\nregulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues. \\nFailure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a \\ntimely basis could result in additional penalties, business \\nrestrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, \\nincreased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, \\nand other negative consequences, which could be significant. \\nWhile we still have significant work to do and have not yet \\nsatisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the \\nCompany is committed to devoting the resources necessary to \\noperate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the \\nhighest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in \\nplace. \\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management \\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company‚Äôs Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board‚Äôs governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company‚Äôs compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB‚Äôs \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company‚Äôs \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company‚Äôs total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements. \\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions \\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company‚Äôs compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest \\nrate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the \\nCompany submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide \\ncompliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the \\nCompany‚Äôs internal audit program with respect to federal \\nconsumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In \\naddition, as required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers \\naffected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and \\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the \\nmanagement of remediation activities conducted by the \\nCompany.

In addition, the consent \\norder restricts the Company from acquiring certain third-party \\nresidential mortgage servicing and limits transfers of certain \\nmortgage loans requiring customer remediation out of the \\nCompany‚Äôs mortgage servicing portfolio until remediation is \\nprovided. \\nConsent Order with the CFPB Regarding Automobile \\nLending, Consumer Deposit Accounts, and Mortgage \\nLending \\nOn December 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent \\norder with the CFPB requiring the Company to provide customer \\nremediation for multiple matters related to automobile lending, \\nconsumer deposit accounts, and mortgage lending; maintain \\npractices designed to ensure auto lending customers receive \\nrefunds for the unused portion of certain guaranteed automobile \\nprotection agreements; comply with certain business practice \\nrequirements related to consumer deposit accounts; and pay a \\n$1.7 billion civil penalty to the CFPB. The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions. \\nRetail Sales Practices Matters \\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired. \\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nFactors‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCustomer Remediation Activities \\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort. \\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. As our \\nongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen our \\nrisk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in the \\nfuture identify additional items or areas of potential concern. To \\nthe extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any \\ncustomer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have \\npreviously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding these activities, \\nincluding related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù \\nsection in our 2022 Form 10-K. Recent Developments \\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment \\nIn May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \\nproposed a rule to recover by special assessment losses to the \\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of recent bank failures. \\nUnder the proposed rule, the FDIC would collect a special \\nassessment based on a calculation using an insured depository \\ninstitution‚Äôs estimated amount of uninsured deposits. As \\ncurrently proposed, the amount of our special assessment may \\nbe up to $1.8 billion (pre-tax), and we expect to expense the \\nentire amount upon the FDIC‚Äôs finalization of the rule. The \\nproposed rule may be changed prior to finalization and any \\nchanges may affect the timing or amount of the special \\nassessment. \\nLIBOR Transition \\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) was a widely \\nreferenced benchmark rate that sought to estimate the cost at \\nwhich banks could borrow on an unsecured basis from other \\nbanks. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom‚Äôs Financial \\nConduct Authority and ICE Benchmark Administration, the \\nadministrator of LIBOR, announced that certain settings of \\nLIBOR would no longer be published on a representative basis \\nafter December 31, 2021, and the most commonly used U.S. \\ndollar (USD) LIBOR settings would no longer be published on a \\nrepresentative basis after June 30, 2023. \\nIn first quarter 2022, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) \\nAct (the LIBOR Act) was enacted into U.S. federal law to provide \\na statutory framework to replace LIBOR with a benchmark rate \\nbased on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in U.S. \\nlaw contracts that do not have fallback provisions or that have \\nfallback provisions resulting in a replacement rate based on \\nLIBOR. The FRB adopted a final rule implementing the LIBOR Act \\non December 16, 2022, which became effective on February 27, \\n2023. \\nWe no longer offer new contracts referencing LIBOR and \\nlegacy contracts indexed to USD LIBOR have transitioned to \\nSOFR-based or other alternative reference rates in accordance \\nwith existing fallback provisions or the LIBOR Act. \\nFor additional information regarding the risks and potential \\nimpact of LIBOR or any other referenced financial metric being \\nsignificantly changed, replaced or discontinued, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nFactors‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCapital Matters \\nIn June 2023, the Company completed the annual \\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) stress test \\nprocess. On July 27, 2023, the FRB confirmed that our stress \\ncapital buffer for the period October 1, 2023, through \\nSeptember 30, 2024, will be 2.90%, which is lower than our \\ncurrent stress capital buffer of 3.20%. \\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany's third quarter 2023 common stock dividend to $0.35 \\nper share and the Company announced that the Board authorized \\na new common stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5. We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company‚Äôs \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nFunds Transfer Pricing Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nRevenue and Expense Sharing When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nTable 5: Management Reporting Structure When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company‚Äôs \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nAllocated Capital Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January 1, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment‚Äôs use of capital. \\nSelected Metrics We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results.

Our off-balance sheet arrangements \\ninclude unfunded credit commitments, transactions with \\nunconsolidated entities, guarantees, commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities, derivatives, and other commitments. \\nThese transactions are designed to (1) meet the financial needs \\nof customers, (2) manage our credit, market or liquidity risks, \\nand/or (3) diversify our funding sources. \\nUnfunded Credit Commitments \\nUnfunded credit commitments are legally binding agreements to \\nlend to customers with terms covering usage of funds, \\ncontractual interest rates, expiration dates, and any required \\ncollateral. The maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these \\ncommitments may expire without being used or may be \\ncancelled at the customer‚Äôs request. Our credit risk monitoring \\nactivities include managing the amount of commitments, both to \\nindividual customers and in total, and the size and maturity \\nstructure of these commitments. For additional information, see \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) to \\nFinancial Statements in this Report. \\nTransactions with Unconsolidated Entities \\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into various types of \\non- and off-balance sheet transactions with special purpose \\nentities (SPEs), which are corporations, trusts, limited liability \\ncompanies or partnerships that are established for a limited \\npurpose. Generally, SPEs are formed in connection with \\nsecuritization transactions and are considered variable interest \\nentities (VIEs). For additional information, see Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Guarantees and Other Arrangements \\nGuarantees are contracts that contingently require us to make \\npayments to a guaranteed party based on an event or a change in \\nan underlying asset, liability, rate or index. Guarantees are \\ngenerally in the form of standby and direct pay letters of credit, \\nwritten options, recourse obligations, exchange and clearing \\nhouse guarantees, indemnifications, and other types of similar \\narrangements. For additional information, see Note 14 \\n(Guarantees and Other Commitments) to Financial Statements \\nin this Report. \\nCommitments to Purchase Debt and Equity Securities \\nWe enter into commitments to purchase securities under resale \\nagreements. We also may enter into commitments to purchase \\ndebt and equity securities to provide capital for customers‚Äô \\nfunding, liquidity or other future needs. For additional \\ninformation, see Note 14 (Guarantees and Other Commitments) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report. \\nDerivatives \\nWe use derivatives to manage exposure to market risk, including \\ninterest rate risk, credit risk and foreign currency risk, and to \\nassist customers with their risk management objectives. \\nDerivatives are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at \\nfair value, and volume can be measured in terms of the notional \\namount, which is generally not exchanged, but is used only as the \\nbasis on which interest and other payments are determined. The \\nnotional amount is not recorded on our consolidated balance \\nsheet and is not, when viewed in isolation, a meaningful measure \\nof the risk profile of the instruments.

The \\ndiscussion that follows supplements our discussion of the \\nmanagement of certain risks contained in the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nCredit Risk Management \\nWe define credit risk as the risk of loss associated with a \\nborrower or counterparty default (failure to meet obligations in \\naccordance with agreed upon terms). Credit risk exists with many \\nof the Company‚Äôs assets and exposures such as debt security \\nholdings, certain derivatives, and loans. \\nThe Board‚Äôs Risk Committee has primary oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. A Credit Subcommittee of the Risk \\nCommittee assists the Risk Committee in providing oversight of \\ncredit risk. At the management level, Corporate Credit Risk, \\nwhich is part of Independent Risk Management, has oversight \\nresponsibility for credit risk. Corporate Credit Risk reports to the \\nChief Risk Officer and supports periodic reports related to credit \\nrisk provided to the Board‚Äôs Risk Committee or its Credit \\nSubcommittee. \\nLoan Portfolio Our loan portfolios represent the largest \\ncomponent of assets on our consolidated balance sheet for which \\nwe have credit risk.

In addition, the Company will continue to integrate climate \\nconsiderations into its credit risk management activities. \\nOur credit risk management oversight process is governed \\ncentrally, but provides for direct management and accountability \\nby our lines of business. Our overall credit process includes \\ncomprehensive credit policies, disciplined credit underwriting, \\nfrequent and detailed risk measurement and modeling, extensive \\ncredit training programs, and a continual loan review and audit \\nprocess. \\nA key to our credit risk management is adherence to a well-\\ncontrolled underwriting process, which we believe is appropriate \\nfor the needs of our customers as well as investors who purchase \\nthe loans or securities collateralized by the loans. \\nCredit Quality Overview Table 11 provides credit quality trends . \\nTable 11: Credit Quality Overview \\n($ in millions) Jun 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nNonaccrual loans \\nCommercial loans $ 3,429 1,823 \\nConsumer loans 3,457 3,803 \\nTotal nonaccrual loans $ 6,886 5,626 \\nNonaccrual loans as a % of total loans 0.73 % 0.59 \\nAllowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans $ 14,786 13,609 \\nACL for loans as a % of total loans 1.56 % 1.42 \\nQuarter ended June 30, \\n2023 2022 \\nNet loan charge-offs as a % of: \\nAverage commercial loans 0.15% 0.02 \\nAverage consumer loans 0.58 0.33 \\nSix months ended June 30, \\n2023 2022 \\nAverage commercial loans 0.10% ‚Äî \\nAverage consumer loans 0.57 0.34 \\nAdditional information on our loan portfolios and our credit \\nquality trends follows. \\nSignificant Loan Portfolio Reviews Our credit risk monitoring \\nprocess is designed to enable early identification of developing \\nrisk and to support our determination of an appropriate \\nallowance for credit losses.

The \\ntotal CRE loan portfolio decreased $1.5 billion from \\nDecember 31, 2022, as paydowns exceeded originations and \\nadvances. The portfolio is diversified both geographically and by \\nproperty type. The largest geographic concentrations of CRE \\nloans are in California, New York, Texas, and Florida, which \\nrepresented a combined 48% of the total CRE portfolio. The \\nlargest property type concentrations are apartments at 26% and \\noffice at 21% of the portfolio. Unfunded credit commitments \\nwere $8.7 billion and $8.8 billion at June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively, for CRE mortgage loans and \\n$16.6 billion and $20.7 billion, respectively, for CRE construction \\nloans. \\nWe generally subject CRE loans to individual risk assessment \\nusing our internal borrower and collateral quality ratings. We had \\nTable 13: CRE Loans by State and Property Type $14.9 billion of CRE mortgage loans classified as criticized at \\nJune 30, 2023, compared with $11.3 billion at December 31, \\n2022, and $1.1 billion of CRE construction loans classified as \\ncriticized at both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The \\nincrease in criticized CRE loans was primarily driven by the office \\nproperty type. The credit quality of the office property type \\ncontinued to be adversely affected as weakened demand for \\noffice space continued to drive higher vacancy rates and \\ndeteriorating operating performance. We continue to closely \\nmonitor this portfolio. At June 30, 2023, nearly one-third of the \\nCRE loans in the office property type had recourse to a \\nguarantor, typically through a repayment guarantee, in addition \\nto the related collateral. Loans in California and New York \\nrepresented approximately 40% of the office property type at \\nJune 30, 2023. \\nTable 13 provides our CRE loans by state and property type. \\nJune 30, 2023 December 31, 2022 \\nReal estate mortgage Real estate construction Total commercial real estate Total commercial real estate \\nLoans \\nLoans Loans Loans as % of Total Loans Total \\nNonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding Nonaccrual outstanding total commitments outstanding commitments \\n($ in millions) loans balance loans balance loans balance loans (1) balance (1) \\nBy state: \\nCalifornia $ 740 28,465 1 4,300 741 32,765 3% $ 37,556 34,285 39,594 \\nNew York 319 14,121 ‚Äî 2,476 319 16,597 2 18,358 17,294 19,360 \\nTexas 20 11,509 ‚Äî 1,393 20 12,902 1 14,815 12,807 14,941 \\nFlorida 65 9,714 ‚Äî 2,091 65 11,805 1 14,417 11,418 14,690 \\nGeorgia 90 4,862 ‚Äî 932 90 5,794 * 7,288 5,428 6,651 \\nWashington 349 4,218 ‚Äî 1,520 349 5,738 * 6,753 5,603 6,868 \\nNorth Carolina 4 4,302 ‚Äî 1,179 4 5,481 * 6,700 5,227 6,650 \\nArizona 16 4,600 ‚Äî 601 16 5,201 * 6,107 5,302 6,288 \\nNew Jersey 6 2,745 ‚Äî 1,490 6 4,235 * 5,346 4,119 5,660 \\nMassachusetts 4 2,763 41 1,311 45 4,074 * 5,187 4,094 5,324 \\nOther (2) 851 42,256 1 7,428 852 49,684 5 57,097 50,225 59,294 \\nTotal $ 2,464 129,555 43 24,721 2,507 154,276 16% $ 179,624 155,802 185,320 \\nBy property: \\nApartments $ 9 30,513 ‚Äî 10,239 9 40,752 4% $ 50,699 39,743 51,567 \\nOffice (3) 1,517 29,437 ‚Äî 3,652 1,517 33,089 3 36,757 36,144 40,827 \\nIndustrial/warehouse 38 19,654 ‚Äî 4,246 38 23,900 3 27,802 20,634 24,546 \\nHotel/motel 149 11,911 ‚Äî 1,012 149 12,923 1 13,910 12,751 13,758 \\nRetail (excl shopping center) 355 11,301 2 111 357 11,412 1 12,334 11,753 12,486 \\nShopping center 193 8,848 ‚Äî 401 193 9,249 * 9,816 9,534 10,131 \\nInstitutional 118 4,160 ‚Äî 1,939 118 6,099 * 6,906 7,725 9,178 \\nMixed use properties 72 4,440 41 903 113 5,343 * 6,330 5,887 7,139 \\nCollateral pool ‚Äî 2,987 ‚Äî 44 ‚Äî 3,031 * 3,410 3,062 3,662 \\nStorage facility ‚Äî 2,819 ‚Äî 164 ‚Äî 2,983 * 3,299 2,929 3,201 \\nOther 13 3,485 ‚Äî 2,010 13 5,495 * 8,361 5,640 8,825 \\nTotal $ 2,464 129,555 43 24,721 2,507 154,276 16 % $ 179,624 155,802 185,320 \\n* Less than 1%. \\n(1) Total commitments consist of loans outstanding plus unfunded credit commitments, excluding issued letters of credit.

We establish exposure \\nlimits for each country through a centralized oversight process \\nbased on customer needs, and through consideration of the \\nrelevant and distinct risk of each country. We monitor exposures \\nclosely and adjust our country limits in response to changing \\nconditions. We evaluate our individual country risk exposure \\nbased on our assessment of a borrower‚Äôs ability to repay, \\nwhich gives consideration for allowable transfers of risk, such as \\nguarantees and collateral, and may be different from the \\nreporting based on a borrower‚Äôs primary address. \\nOur largest single country exposure outside the U.S. at \\nJune 30, 2023, was the United Kingdom, which totaled \\nTable 14: Select Country Exposures $28.6 billion, or approximately 2% of our total assets, and \\nincluded $3.2 billion of sovereign claims.

The process for establishing the ACL for loans takes into \\nconsideration many factors, including historical and forecasted \\nloss trends, loan-level credit quality ratings and loan grade-\\nspecific characteristics. The process involves subjective and \\ncomplex judgments. In addition, we review a variety of credit \\nmetrics and trends. These credit metrics and trends, however, do \\nnot solely determine the amount of the allowance as we use \\nseveral analytical tools.

The entire allowance \\nis available to absorb credit losses from the total loan portfolio. \\nThe ACL for loans is subject to change and reflects existing \\nfactors as of the date of determination, including economic or \\nmarket conditions and ongoing internal and external examination \\nprocesses. Due to the sensitivity of the ACL for loans to changes \\nin the economic and business environment, it is possible that we \\nwill incur incremental credit losses not anticipated as of the \\nbalance sheet date. Our process for determining the ACL is \\ndiscussed in the ‚ÄúCritical Accounting Policies ‚Äì Allowance for \\nCredit Losses‚Äù section and Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) to Financial Statements in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING ACTIVITIES We sell residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans to various parties. In connection with \\nour sales and securitization of residential mortgage loans, we \\nhave established a mortgage repurchase liability. For information \\non our repurchase liability, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Credit \\nRisk Management ‚Äì Mortgage Banking Activities‚Äù section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nIn addition to servicing loans in our portfolio, we act as \\nservicer and/or master servicer of residential and commercial \\nmortgage loans included in GSE-guaranteed mortgage \\nsecuritizations, GNMA-guaranteed mortgage securitizations of \\nFHA-insured/VA-guaranteed mortgages and private label \\nmortgage securitizations, as well as for unsecuritized loans \\nowned by institutional investors. \\nAs a servicer, we are required to advance certain delinquent \\npayments of principal and interest on mortgage loans we service. \\nThe amount and timing of reimbursement for advances of \\ndelinquent payments vary by investor and the applicable \\nservicing agreements. See Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer \\nadvances and servicing fees. \\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines, upon \\ntransfer as servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans \\nfrom GNMA loan securitization pools, which generally becomes \\nexercisable when three scheduled loan payments remain unpaid \\nby the borrower. We may repurchase these loans for cash and as \\na result, our total consolidated assets do not change. \\nRepurchased loans that regain current status or are otherwise \\nmodified in accordance with applicable servicing guidelines may \\nbe included in future GNMA loan securitization pools. At June 30, \\n2023, and December 31, 2022, these loans, which we have \\nrepurchased or have the option to repurchase, were $8.5 billion \\nand $9.8 billion, respectively, which included $7.8 billion and \\n$8.6 billion, respectively, in loans held for investment, with the \\nremainder in loans held for sale. See Note 13 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information about our involvement with mortgage \\nloan securitizations. \\nFor additional information about the risks related to our \\nservicing activities, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Credit Risk \\nManagement ‚Äì Mortgage Banking Activities‚Äù section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. For additional information on mortgage banking \\nactivities, see Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report. Asset/Liability Management \\nAsset/liability management involves evaluating, monitoring and \\nmanaging interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. For \\ninformation on our oversight of asset/liability risks, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management‚Äù section in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. \\nINTEREST RATE RISK Interest rate risk is the risk that market \\nfluctuations in interest rates, credit spreads, or foreign exchange \\ncan cause a loss of the Company‚Äôs earnings and capital stemming \\nfrom mismatches in the Company‚Äôs asset and liability cash flows \\nprimarily arising from customer-related activities such as lending \\nand deposit-taking. We are subject to interest rate risk because: \\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest \\nrates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase; \\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by \\ndifferent amounts; \\n‚Ä¢ short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nby different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield \\ncurve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs \\ndifferently; \\n‚Ä¢ the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if \\nlong-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, \\nmortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate \\nthan anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or \\n‚Ä¢ interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan \\ndemand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage \\norigination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other \\nfinancial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the \\ndegree of change over time, the speed of change and the \\nprojected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require \\nassumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet \\ncomposition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans \\nand debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing \\nstrategies. \\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24, \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months \\nusing instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both \\nlower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. \\nSteeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in \\nthe yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors \\nthree years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as \\nall tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar \\ninterest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the \\nsimulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24: \\n‚Ä¢ Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to \\nour assets and liabilities. \\n‚Ä¢ Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant. \\n‚Ä¢ Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates. \\nWells Fargo & Company 39 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Deposit \\nmix is modeled to be the same in the base scenario and the \\nalternative scenarios. In higher interest rate scenarios, \\ncustomer deposit activity that shifts balances into higher \\nyielding products could impact expected net interest \\nincome. \\n‚Ä¢ The interest rate sensitivity of deposits is modeled using the \\nhistorical behavior of our deposits portfolio and reflects the \\nexpectations of deposit products repricing as market \\ninterest rates change (referred to as deposit betas). Our \\nactual experience in base and alternative scenarios may \\ndiffer from expectations due to the lag or acceleration of \\ndeposit repricing, changes in consumer behavior, and other \\nfactors. \\n‚Ä¢ We hold the size of the projected debt and equity securities \\nportfolios constant across scenarios. \\nTable 24: Net Interest Income Sensitivity Over the Next 12 Months \\nUsing Instantaneous Movements \\n($ in billions) Jun 30, 2023 Dec 31, 2022 \\nParallel shift: \\n+100 bps shift in interest rates $ 1.8 2.3 \\n-100 bps shift in interest rates (2.1) (1.7) \\nSteeper yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in long-term interest rates 1.0 0.8 \\n-100 bps shift in short-term interest rates (1.1) (1.0) \\nFlatter yield curve: \\n+100 bps shift in short-term interest rates 0.8 1.5 \\n-100 bps shift in long-term interest rates (1.0) (0.7) \\nThe changes in our interest rate sensitivity from \\nDecember 31, 2022, to June 30, 2023, in Table 24 reflected \\nupdates to our base scenario, including expectations for balance \\nsheet composition and interest rates. Our interest rate \\nsensitivity indicates that we would expect to benefit from higher \\ninterest rates as our assets would reprice faster and to a greater \\ndegree than our liabilities, while in the case of lower interest \\nrates, our assets would reprice downward and to a greater degree \\nthan our liabilities resulting in lower net interest income. \\nThe sensitivity results above do not capture noninterest \\nincome or expense impacts. Our interest rate sensitive \\nnoninterest income and expense are impacted by mortgage \\nbanking activities that may have sensitivity impacts that move in \\nthe opposite direction of our net interest income. See the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì Mortgage Banking \\nInterest Rate and Market Risk‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K \\nfor additional information. \\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\non commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional \\ninformation on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2 \\n(Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage \\nour interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in the fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers \\nthe amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes \\nunrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt \\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized \\ninto earnings over the life of the security with no further impact \\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) and Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We \\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in the following \\nmain ways: \\n‚Ä¢ to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning \\ndeposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from \\nfloating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice \\nversa; \\n‚Ä¢ to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities \\nportfolio; and \\n‚Ä¢ to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, \\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs. \\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 11 (Derivatives) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK We \\noriginate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans. \\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate ‚Äúlocks‚Äù) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates. For additional information on mortgage banking, including \\nkey assumptions and the sensitivity of the fair value of MSRs, see \\nthe ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì \\nMortgage Banking Interest Rate and Market Risk‚Äù section and \\nNote 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities), Note 14 (Derivatives), and \\nNote 15 (Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities) to Financial \\nStatements in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nMARKET RISK Market risk is the risk of possible economic loss \\nfrom adverse changes in market risk factors such as interest \\nrates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \\ncommodity prices, and the risk of possible loss due to \\ncounterparty exposure. This applies to implied volatility risk, \\nbasis risk, and market liquidity risk. It includes price risk in the \\ntrading book, mortgage servicing rights and the hedge \\neffectiveness risk associated with mortgage loans held at fair \\nvalue, and impairment of private equity investments.

These trading activities \\npredominantly occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \\nextent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \\nfor trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans and \\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities, and all are carried at fair value. Income earned on the \\nfinancial instruments used in our trading activities include net \\ninterest income, changes in fair value and realized gains and \\nlosses. Net interest income earned from our trading activities is \\nreflected in the interest income and interest expense \\ncomponents of our consolidated statement of income. Changes \\nin fair value of the financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities are reflected in net gains from trading activities. For \\nadditional information on the financial instruments used in our \\ntrading activities and the income from these trading activities, \\nTable 25: Trading 1-Day 99% General VaR by Risk Category see Note 2 (Trading Activities) to Financial Statements in this \\nReport. \\nValue-at-risk (VaR) is a statistical risk measure used to \\nestimate the potential loss from adverse moves in the financial \\nmarkets. The Company uses VaR metrics complemented with \\nsensitivity analysis and stress testing in measuring and \\nmonitoring market risk. For additional information on our \\nmonitoring activities, sensitivity analysis and stress testing, see \\nthe ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì Market \\nRisk ‚Äì Trading Activities‚Äù section in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTrading VaR is the measure used to provide insight into the \\nmarket risk exhibited by the Company‚Äôs trading positions. The \\nCompany calculates Trading VaR for risk management purposes \\nto establish and monitor line of business and Company-wide risk \\nlimits. Trading VaR is calculated based on all trading positions on \\nour consolidated balance sheet. \\nTable 25 shows the Company‚Äôs Trading General VaR by risk \\ncategory. The increase in average Company Trading General VaR \\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2023, compared with the same \\nperiod a year ago, was primarily driven by changes in portfolio \\ncomposition. \\nQuarter ended \\nJune 30, 2023 March 31, 2023 June 30, 2022 \\nPeriod Period Period \\n(in millions) end Average Low High end Average Low High end Average Low High \\nCompany Trading General VaR Risk Categories \\nCredit 50 39 21 51 34 27 20 37 28 31 21 40 \\nInterest rate 42 44 29 65 40 32 19 48 26 23 11 35 \\nEquity 19 19 13 24 24 24 19 31 20 24 17 36 \\nCommodity 4 4 3 6 3 4 3 8 5 5 4 7 \\nForeign exchange 1 1 0 4 0 1 0 3 1 1 0 1 \\nDiversification benefit (1) (78) (72) (67) (49) (44) (52) \\nCompany Trading General VaR $ 38 35 34 39 36 32 \\n(1) The period-end VaR was less than the sum of the VaR components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect arises because the risks are not perfectly \\ncorrelated causing a portfolio of positions to usually be less risky than the sum of the risks of the positions alone. The diversification benefit is not meaningful for low and high metrics since they may \\noccur on different days. \\nMARKET RISK ‚Äì EQUITY SECURITIES We are directly and indirectly \\naffected by changes in the equity markets. We make and manage \\ndirect investments in start-up businesses, emerging growth \\ncompanies, management buy-outs, acquisitions and corporate \\nrecapitalizations. We also invest in non-affiliated funds that \\nmake similar private equity investments. For additional \\ninformation, see the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Asset/Liability \\nManagement ‚Äì Market Risk ‚Äì Equity Securities‚Äù section in our \\n2022 Form 10-K. \\nWe also have marketable equity securities that include \\ninvestments relating to our venture capital activities. The fair \\nvalue changes in these marketable equity securities are \\nrecognized in net income. For additional information, see Note 4 \\n(Equity Securities) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \\nmanagement and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \\nto repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \\nother business activities. Each business line monitors and \\nmanages these indirect risks. \\nLIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they come due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \\nincurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to ensure that we can meet our contractual \\nobligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both \\nnormal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-\\nspecific and/or market stress. \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets. These guidelines are \\nmonitored on a monthly basis by the management-level \\nCorporate Asset/Liability Committee and on a quarterly basis by \\nthe Board. These guidelines are established and monitored for \\nboth the Company and the Parent on a stand-alone basis so that \\nthe Parent is a source of strength for its banking subsidiaries.

The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells Fargo. \\nWe are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \\nFDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \\nTable 26: Liquidity Coverage Ratio net stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \\norganization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \\namount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \\ndebt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \\nderivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \\nperiod. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \\ntotal assets of $10 billion or more. As of June 30, 2023, we were \\ncompliant with the NSFR requirement. \\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio As of June 30, 2023, the Company, \\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A., and Wells Fargo National Bank West \\nexceeded the minimum LCR requirement of 100%. \\nTable 26 presents the Company‚Äôs quarterly average values for \\nthe daily-calculated LCR and its components calculated pursuant \\nto the LCR rule requirements.

Our objective is to maintain capital at an \\namount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance \\nobjectives, and to meet both regulatory and market \\nexpectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the \\nretention of earnings net of both dividends and share \\nrepurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock \\nand long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at June 30, \\n2023, increased $7.2 billion from December 31, 2022, \\npredominantly as a result of $9.9 billion of Wells Fargo net \\nincome, partially offset by $2.9 billion of common and preferred \\nstock dividends. During the first half of 2023, we issued \\n$860 million of common stock, substantially all of which was \\nissued in connection with employee compensation and benefits. \\nIn the first half of 2023, we repurchased 187 million shares of \\ncommon stock at a cost of $8.1 billion. For additional information \\nabout capital planning, see the ‚ÄúCapital Planning and Stress \\nTesting‚Äù section below. \\nIn July 2023, we issued $1.725 billion of our Preferred Stock, \\nSeries EE. \\nRegulatory Capital Requirements \\nThe Company and each of our IDIs are subject to various \\nregulatory capital adequacy requirements administered by the \\nFRB and the OCC. Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \\nratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \\nimplement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \\norganizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on a preliminary assessment of the \\nproposed rule. The Company is considering a range of potential \\nactions to address the impact of the proposed rule, including \\nbalance sheet and capital optimization strategies. \\nTable 31 and Table 32 present the risk-based capital \\nrequirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized \\nApproach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of June 30, \\n2023.

Because the stress \\ncapital buffer is calculated annually based on data that can differ \\nover time, our stress capital buffer, and thus our risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements under the Standardized Approach, are \\nsubject to change in future periods. Our stress capital buffer for \\nthe period October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2023, is \\n3.20%. On July 27, 2023, the FRB confirmed that the Company‚Äôs \\nstress capital buffer for the period October 1, 2023, through \\nSeptember 30, 2024, will be 2.90%. \\nAs a global systemically important bank (G-SIB), we are also \\nsubject to the FRB‚Äôs rule implementing an additional capital \\nsurcharge between 1.00-4.50% on the risk-based capital ratio \\nrequirements of G-SIBs. Under the rule, we must annually \\ncalculate our surcharge under two methods and use the higher \\nof the two surcharges. The first method (method one) considers \\nour size, interconnectedness, cross-jurisdictional activity, \\nsubstitutability, and complexity, consistent with the \\nmethodology developed by the BCBS and the Financial Stability \\nBoard (FSB). The second method (method two) uses similar \\ninputs, but replaces substitutability with use of short-term \\nTable 33: Capital Components and Ratios wholesale funding and will generally result in higher surcharges \\nthan under method one. Because the G-SIB capital surcharge is \\ncalculated annually based on data that can differ over time, the \\namount of the surcharge is subject to change in future years. If \\nour annual calculation results in a decrease to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the decrease takes effect the next calendar year. If our \\nannual calculation results in an increase to our G-SIB capital \\nsurcharge, the increase takes effect in two calendar years. Our G-\\nSIB capital surcharge will continue to be 1.50% in 2023. On \\nJuly 27, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would impact \\nthe methodology used to calculate the G-SIB capital surcharge. \\nUnder the risk-based capital rules, on-balance sheet assets \\nand credit equivalent amounts of derivatives and off-balance \\nsheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk categories \\naccording to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the \\nnature of any collateral.

U.S. G-SIBs are required \\nto have a minimum amount of TLAC (consisting of CET1 capital \\nand additional Tier 1 capital issued directly by the top-tier or \\ncovered BHC plus eligible external long-term debt) to avoid \\nrestrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus \\npayments as well as a minimum amount of eligible unsecured \\nlong-term debt. The components used to calculate our minimum \\nTLAC and eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements as of \\nJune 30, 2023, are presented in Table 41. \\nTable 41: Components Used to Calculate TLAC and Eligible Unsecured \\nLong-Term Debt Requirements \\nTLAC requirement \\nGreater of: \\n7.50% of total leverage exposure \\n18.00% of RWAs (the denominator of the SLR\\ncalculation) \\n+ + \\nExternal TLAC leverage buffer TLAC buffer (equal to 2.50% of RWAs \\n(equal to 2.00% of total leverage + method one G-SIB capital surcharge \\nexposure) + any countercyclical buffer) \\nMinimum amount of eligible unsecured long-term debt \\nGreater of: \\n6.00% of RWAs \\n+ 4.50% of total leverage exposure \\nGreater of method one and method \\ntwo G-SIB capital surcharge \\nThe FRB and OCC have proposed amendments to the TLAC \\nand eligible unsecured long-term debt requirements.

As of June 30, 2023, these broker-dealer \\nsubsidiaries were in compliance with their respective regulatory \\nminimum net capital requirements. \\nCapital Planning and Stress Testing \\nOur planned long-term capital structure is designed to meet \\nregulatory and market expectations. We believe that our long-\\nterm targeted capital structure enables us to invest in and grow \\nour business, satisfy our customers‚Äô financial needs in varying \\nenvironments, access markets, and maintain flexibility to return \\ncapital to our shareholders. Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers. \\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans. \\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB \\nreviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the \\nDodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all \\nlarge BHCs and also reviews the Company‚Äôs proposed capital \\nactions. The FRB published its supervisory stress test results on \\nJune 28, 2023. \\nOn July 25, 2023, the Board approved an increase to the \\nCompany's third quarter 2023 common stock dividend to $0.35 \\nper share. \\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\nWells Fargo & Company 50 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Although we announce \\nwhen the Board authorizes share repurchases, we typically do not \\ngive any public notice before we repurchase our shares. Various \\nfactors determine the amount of our share repurchases, \\nincluding our capital requirements, the number of shares we \\nexpect to issue for employee benefit plans and any acquisitions, \\nmarket conditions (including the trading price of our stock), and \\nregulatory and legal considerations, including under the FRB‚Äôs \\ncapital plan rule. Due to the various factors that may impact the \\namount of our share repurchases and the fact that we tend to be \\nRegulatory Matters in the market regularly to satisfy repurchase considerations \\nunder our capital plan, our share repurchases occur at various \\nprice levels. We may suspend share repurchase activity at any \\ntime. \\nAt June 30, 2023, we had remaining Board authority to \\nrepurchase approximately 64 million shares, subject to \\nregulatory and legal conditions. The Company publicly \\nannounced on July 25, 2023, that the Board authorized a new \\ncommon stock repurchase program of up to $30 billion. Unless \\nmodified or revoked by the Board, this authorization does not \\nexpire and supersedes the prior share repurchase authority \\napproved by the Board. \\nFor additional information about share repurchases during \\nsecond quarter 2023, see Part II, Item 2 in this Report. \\nThe U.S. financial services industry is subject to significant \\nregulation and regulatory oversight initiatives. This regulation \\nand oversight may continue to impact how U.S. financial services \\ncompanies conduct business and may continue to result in \\nincreased regulatory compliance costs. \\nFor a discussion of certain consent orders applicable to the \\nCompany, see the ‚ÄúOverview‚Äù section in this Report. The \\nfollowing supplements our discussion of other significant \\nregulations and regulatory oversight initiatives that have \\naffected or may affect our business contained in the ‚ÄúRegulatory \\nMatters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù sections in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\n‚ÄúLiving Will‚Äù Requirements and Related Matters \\nRules adopted by the FRB and the FDIC under the Dodd-Frank \\nAct require large financial institutions, including Wells Fargo, to \\nprepare and periodically submit resolution plans, also known as \\n‚Äúliving wills,‚Äù that would facilitate their rapid and orderly \\nresolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. \\nUnder the rules, rapid and orderly resolution means a \\nreorganization or liquidation of the covered company under the \\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code that can be accomplished in a reasonable \\nperiod of time and in a manner that substantially mitigates the \\nrisk that failure would have serious adverse effects on the \\nfinancial stability of the United States. In addition to the \\nCompany‚Äôs resolution plan, our national bank subsidiary, Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A. (the ‚ÄúBank‚Äù), is also required to prepare and \\nperiodically submit a resolution plan. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\ndetermine that our resolution plan has deficiencies, they may \\nimpose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements \\non us or restrict our growth, activities or operations until we \\nadequately remedy the deficiencies. If the FRB and/or FDIC \\nultimately determine that we have been unable to remedy any \\ndeficiencies, they could require us to divest certain assets or \\noperations. On June 27, 2023, we submitted our most recent \\nresolution plan to the FRB and FDIC. \\nIf Wells Fargo were to fail, it may be resolved in a bankruptcy \\nproceeding or, if certain conditions are met, under the resolution \\nregime created by the Dodd-Frank Act known as the ‚Äúorderly \\nliquidation authority.‚Äù The orderly liquidation authority allows for \\nthe appointment of the FDIC as receiver for a systemically \\nimportant financial institution that is in default or in danger of \\ndefault if, among other things, the resolution of the institution \\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code would have serious adverse \\neffects on financial stability in the United States. If the FDIC is \\nappointed as receiver for the Parent, then the orderly liquidation \\nauthority, rather than the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, would determine the powers of the receiver and the rights and \\nobligations of our security holders. The FDIC‚Äôs orderly liquidation \\nauthority requires that security holders of a company in \\nreceivership bear all losses before U.S. taxpayers are exposed to \\nany losses. There are substantial differences in the rights of \\ncreditors between the orderly liquidation authority and the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, including the right of the FDIC to disregard the \\nstrict priority of creditor claims under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code \\nin certain circumstances and the use of an administrative claims \\nprocedure instead of a judicial procedure to determine creditors‚Äô \\nclaims. \\nThe strategy described in our most recent resolution plan is \\na single point of entry strategy, in which the Parent would be the \\nonly material legal entity to enter resolution proceedings. \\nHowever, the strategy described in our resolution plan is not \\nbinding in the event of an actual resolution of Wells Fargo, \\nwhether conducted under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or by the \\nFDIC under the orderly liquidation authority. The FDIC has \\nannounced that a single point of entry strategy may be a \\ndesirable strategy under its implementation of the orderly \\nliquidation authority, but not all aspects of how the FDIC might \\nexercise this authority are known and additional rulemaking is \\npossible. \\nTo facilitate the orderly resolution of systemically important \\nfinancial institutions in case of material distress or failure, federal \\nbanking regulations require that institutions, such as Wells Fargo, \\nmaintain a minimum amount of equity and unsecured debt to \\nabsorb losses and recapitalize operating subsidiaries. Federal \\nbanking regulators have also required measures to facilitate the \\ncontinued operation of operating subsidiaries notwithstanding \\nthe failure of their parent companies, such as limitations on \\nparent guarantees, and have issued guidance encouraging \\ninstitutions to take legally binding measures to provide capital \\nand liquidity resources to certain subsidiaries to facilitate an \\norderly resolution. In response to the regulators‚Äô guidance and to \\nfacilitate the orderly resolution of the Company, on June 28, \\n2017, the Parent entered into a support agreement, as amended \\nand restated on June 26, 2019 (the ‚ÄúSupport Agreement‚Äù), with \\nWFC Holdings, LLC, an intermediate holding company and \\nsubsidiary of the Parent (the ‚ÄúIHC‚Äù), the Bank, Wells Fargo \\nSecurities, LLC (‚ÄúWFS‚Äù), Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC \\n(‚ÄúWFCS‚Äù), and certain other subsidiaries of the Parent designated \\nfrom time to time as material entities for resolution planning \\npurposes (the ‚ÄúCovered Entities‚Äù) or identified from time to time \\nas related support entities in our resolution plan (the ‚ÄúRelated \\nSupport Entities‚Äù).

If certain liquidity and/ \\nor capital metrics fall below defined triggers, or if the Parent‚Äôs \\nboard of directors authorizes it to file a case under the U.S. \\nBankruptcy Code, the subordinated notes would be forgiven, the \\ncommitted line of credit would terminate, and the IHC‚Äôs ability to \\npay dividends to the Parent would be restricted, any of which \\ncould materially and adversely impact the Parent‚Äôs liquidity and \\nits ability to satisfy its debts and other obligations, and could \\nresult in the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings by the \\nParent at an earlier time than might have otherwise occurred if \\nthe Support Agreement were not implemented.

These policies govern: \\n‚Ä¢ the allowance for credit losses; \\n‚Ä¢ the valuation of residential MSRs; \\n‚Ä¢ the fair value of financial instruments; \\n‚Ä¢ income taxes; \\n‚Ä¢ liability for contingent litigation losses; and \\n‚Ä¢ goodwill impairment. \\nManagement has discussed these critical accounting policies \\nand the related estimates and judgments with the Board‚Äôs Audit \\nCommittee.

The \\nUpdate requires a separate accounting \\npolicy election for each tax credit \\nprogram. For any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected, all investments within \\nthat program that meet eligibility \\ncriteria are required to apply the \\nproportional amortization method. The \\nUpdate also requires additional \\ndisclosures for any tax credit program \\nwhere the proportional amortization \\nmethod is elected. The Update eliminates the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC)-only scope limitation of the \\nproportional amortization method and permits entities to account for all tax credit investments made \\nprimarily for the purpose of receiving income tax credits and income tax benefits using a consistent \\naccounting method. Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at \\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. \\nThe amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are \\nrecorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified \\nretrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. \\nUpon adoption of the Update, we will identify our tax credit programs and make a separate accounting \\npolicy election as to whether to apply the proportional amortization method for each program. For any \\ninvestments that will apply the proportional amortization method upon adoption of the Update, the \\ncumulative effect of the difference between the current carrying value and the carrying value under the \\nproportional amortization method will be recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained \\nearnings, the period of which is dependent upon which transition method is selected. \\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of the Update on our consolidated financial statements. \\nOther Accounting Developments \\nThe following Update is applicable to us but is not expected to \\nhave a material impact on our consolidated financial statements: \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2022-03 ‚Äì Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Fair \\nValue Measurement of Equity Securities Subject to Contractual \\nSale Restrictions \\nWells Fargo & Company 54 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

No change occurred during second quarter \\n2023 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company‚Äôs internal control over financial reporting. \\nWells Fargo & Company 58 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We provide banking, investment and mortgage \\nproducts and services, as well as consumer and commercial \\nfinance, through banking locations and offices, the internet and \\nother distribution channels to individuals, businesses and \\ninstitutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and in \\ncountries outside the U.S. When we refer to ‚ÄúWells Fargo,‚Äù ‚Äúthe \\nCompany,‚Äù ‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour‚Äù or ‚Äúus,‚Äù we mean Wells Fargo & Company \\nand Subsidiaries (consolidated). Wells Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany. We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding. \\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. For discussion of our significant \\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were \\nno material changes to these policies in the first half of 2023. \\nTo prepare the financial statements in conformity with \\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on \\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for \\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the \\ndate of the financial statements, income and expenses during the \\nreporting period and the related disclosures. Although our \\nestimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect \\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual \\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, \\nwhich could materially affect our results of operations and \\nfinancial condition. Management has made significant estimates \\nin several areas, including: \\n‚Ä¢ allowance for credit losses (Note 5 (Loans and Related \\nAllowance for Credit Losses)); \\n‚Ä¢ valuations of residential mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) \\n(Note 6 (Mortgage Banking Activities) and Note 13 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities)); \\n‚Ä¢ valuations of financial instruments (Note 12 (Fair Values of \\nAssets and Liabilities)); \\n‚Ä¢ liabilities for contingent litigation losses (Note 10 (Legal \\nActions)); \\n‚Ä¢ income taxes; and \\n‚Ä¢ goodwill impairment (Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other \\nAssets)). \\nActual results could differ from those estimates. \\nThese unaudited interim financial statements reflect all \\nadjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary \\nfor a fair statement of the results for the periods presented. \\nThese adjustments are of a normal recurring nature, unless \\notherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q. The results of operations \\nin the interim financial statements do not necessarily indicate the \\nresults that may be expected for the full year. The interim \\nfinancial information should be read in conjunction with our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023 \\nIn 2023, we adopted the following new accounting guidance: \\n‚Ä¢ Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2022-02, Financial \\nInstruments ‚Äì Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt \\nRestructurings and Vintage Disclosures \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2022-01, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Fair \\nValue Hedging ‚Äì Portfolio Layer Method \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): \\nAccounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from \\nContracts with Customers \\n‚Ä¢ ASU 2018-12, Financial Services ‚Äì Insurance (Topic 944): \\nTargeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration \\nContracts and subsequent related updates \\nASU 2022-02 eliminates the accounting and reporting for \\ntroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) by creditors and introduces \\nnew required disclosures for loan modifications made to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty. The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5 (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis. \\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million, pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million, after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans. \\nASU 2022-01 establishes the portfolio layer method, which \\nexpands an entity's ability to achieve fair value hedge accounting \\nfor interest rate risk hedges of closed portfolios of financial \\nassets. The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method. \\nWells Fargo & Company 65 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders‚Äô equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio. \\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date. \\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566 million of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \\nsecurities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3 (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities) for additional information about the Company's \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11 \\n(Derivatives) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships. \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 ‚Äì Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 ‚Äì Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12 changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder‚Äôs account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts. \\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by \\n$176 million and $44 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2022. \\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption. \\nTable 1.1 presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income and consolidated balance sheet for the three and six \\nmonths ended June 30, 2022, and as of December 31, 2022. \\nThese adjustments are also reflected in our consolidated \\nstatement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of \\ncash flows. \\nWells Fargo & Company 66 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The credit quality \\nindicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings \\nand delinquency status and are based on information as of our \\nfinancial statement date. \\nCREDIT RATINGS Credit ratings express opinions about the credit \\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a \\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by \\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). \\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings \\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are \\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities \\nrated below investment grade, labeled as ‚Äúspeculative grade‚Äù by \\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher \\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt \\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit \\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management \\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major \\ncredit agencies. Substantially all of our debt securities were rated \\nby NRSROs at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. \\nTable 3.4 shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined \\nto be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based \\non internal credit grades. \\nWells Fargo & Company 70 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Our commercial lending commitments include, but are \\nnot limited to, (i) commitments for working capital and general \\ncorporate purposes, (ii) financing to customers who warehouse \\nfinancial assets secured by real estate, consumer, or corporate \\nloans, (iii) financing that is expected to be syndicated or replaced \\nwith other forms of long-term financing, and (iv) commercial real \\nestate lending. We also originate multipurpose lending \\ncommitments under which commercial customers have the \\noption to draw on the facility in one of several forms, including \\nthe issuance of letters of credit, which reduces the unfunded \\ncommitment amounts of the facility. \\nThe maximum credit risk for these commitments will \\ngenerally be lower than the contractual amount because these \\ncommitments may expire without being used or may be \\ncancelled at the customer‚Äôs request. We may reduce or cancel \\nlines of credit in accordance with the contracts and applicable \\nlaw. Our credit risk monitoring activities include managing the \\namount of commitments, both to individual customers and in \\ntotal, and the size and maturity structure of these commitments. \\nWe do not recognize an ACL for commitments that are \\nunconditionally cancellable at our discretion. \\nWe issue commercial letters of credit to assist customers in \\npurchasing goods or services, typically for international trade. At \\nJune 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, we had $1.2 billion and \\n$1.8 billion, respectively, of outstanding issued commercial \\nletters of credit. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other \\nCommitments) for additional information on issued standby \\nletters of credit. We may be a fronting bank, whereby we act as a \\nrepresentative for other lenders, and advance funds or provide \\nfor the issuance of letters of credit under syndicated loan or \\nletter of credit agreements. Any advances are generally repaid in \\nless than a week and would normally require default of both the \\ncustomer and another lender to expose us to loss. \\nThe contractual amount of our unfunded credit \\ncommitments, including unissued letters of credit, is summarized \\nin Table 5.4. The table is presented net of commitments \\nsyndicated to others, including the fronting arrangements \\ndescribed above, and excludes issued letters of credit and \\ndiscretionary amounts where our approval or consent is required \\nprior to any loan funding or commitment increase. \\nTable 5.4: Unfunded Credit Commitments \\nJun 30, Dec 31, \\n(in millions) 2023 2022 \\nCommercial and industrial (1) $ 385,949 388,504 \\nCommercial real estate 25,348 29,518 \\nTotal commercial 411,297 418,022 \\nResidential mortgage (2) 34,668 39,155 \\nCredit card 157,271 145,526 \\nOther consumer (3) 78,032 69,244 \\nTotal consumer 269,971 253,925 \\nTotal unfunded credit commitments $ 681,268 671,947 \\n(1) Effective first quarter 2023, unfunded credit commitments exclude discretionary amounts \\nwhere our approval or consent is required prior to any loan funding or commitment \\nincrease.

Our ratings \\nare aligned to regulatory definitions of pass and criticized \\ncategories with the criticized segmented among special mention, \\nsubstandard, doubtful and loss categories. \\nTable 5.7 provides the outstanding balances of our \\ncommercial loan portfolio by risk category and credit quality \\ninformation by origination year for term loans. Revolving loans \\nmay convert to term loans as a result of a contractual provision in \\nthe original loan agreement or if modified for a borrower \\nexperiencing financial difficulty.

Loan \\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\\nto-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \\nloan portfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class are \\nincluded in the following tables for the six months ended June 30, \\n2023, which we monitor as part of our credit risk management \\npractices; however, charge-offs are not a primary credit quality \\nindicator for our loan portfolio. \\nMany of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \\nis an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \\nour ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is \\nprovided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a \\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty. \\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores \\nare generally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9 provides the outstanding balances of our \\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality \\nindicators. \\nLTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan‚Äôs outstanding \\nbalance to the property‚Äôs collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) \\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien \\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line \\nproducts) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade \\napproach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1 million or more, as the AVM values have proven less \\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs \\nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV \\nor CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions. \\nWells Fargo & Company 82 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower‚Äôs request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis. \\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $132 million at June 30, 2023. \\nTable 5.15: Commercial Loan Modifications Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower‚Äôs interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower‚Äôs revolving charge privileges are revoked. \\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid \\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized \\ncost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in \\nthe disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost \\nbalances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is \\nexcluded. See Note 7 (Intangible Assets and Other Assets) for \\nadditional information on accrued interest receivable. Borrowers \\nexperiencing financial difficulty with modified terms mandated \\nby a bankruptcy court are considered contractually modified \\nloans and are included in these disclosures.

We do not \\nconsider loan resolutions such as foreclosure or short sale to be a \\nTDR. In addition, COVID-19-related modifications are generally \\nnot classified as TDRs due to the relief under the CARES Act and \\nthe Interagency Statement. For additional information on the \\nTDR relief, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting \\nPolicies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. We may require some consumer borrowers experiencing \\nfinancial difficulty to make trial payments, generally for a period \\nof three to four months, according to the terms of a planned \\npermanent modification, to determine if they can perform \\naccording to those terms. These arrangements represent trial \\nmodifications, which we classified and accounted for as TDRs \\nthrough December 31, 2022, prior to the adoption of ASU \\n2022-02.

The reported amounts include loans that are new TDRs that may have COVID-19-related payment \\ndeferrals and exclude COVID-19-related payment deferrals on loans previously reported as TDRs given limited current financial effects other than payment deferral. \\n(3) Charge-offs include write-downs of the investment in the loan in the period it is contractually modified. The amount of charge-off will differ from the modification terms if the loan has been charged \\ndown prior to the modification based on our policies. In addition, there may be cases where we have a charge-off/down with no legal principal modification. \\n(4) Recorded investment related to interest rate reduction reflects the effect of reduced interest rates on loans with an interest rate concession as one of their concession types, which includes loans \\nreported as a principal primary modification type that also have an interest rate concession. \\n(5) Trial modifications are granted a delay in payments due under the original terms during the trial payment period. However, these loans continue to advance through delinquency status and accrue \\ninterest according to their original terms. Any subsequent permanent modification generally includes interest rate related concessions; however, the exact concession type and resulting financial \\neffect are usually not known until the loan is permanently modified. Trial modifications for the period are presented net of previously reported trial modifications that became permanent in the \\ncurrent period. \\nTable 5.18 summarizes permanent modification TDRs that \\ndefaulted during the period presented within 12 months of their \\npermanent modification date.

These proceedings \\nand investigations include actions brought against Wells Fargo \\nand/or our subsidiaries with respect to corporate-related \\nmatters and transactions in which Wells Fargo and/or our \\nsubsidiaries were involved. In addition, Wells Fargo and our \\nsubsidiaries may be requested to provide information to or \\notherwise cooperate with government authorities in the conduct \\nof investigations of other persons or industry groups. \\nWe establish accruals for legal actions when potential losses \\nassociated with the actions become probable and the costs can \\nbe reasonably estimated. For such accruals, we record the \\namount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of \\npotential losses that are both probable and estimable; however, if \\nwe cannot determine a best estimate, then we record the low \\nend of the range of those potential losses. There can be no \\nassurance as to the ultimate outcome of legal actions, including \\nthe matters described below, and the actual costs of resolving \\nlegal actions may be substantially higher or lower than the \\namounts accrued for those actions. \\nAUTOMOBILE LENDING MATTERS On April 20, 2018, the Company \\nentered into consent orders with the Office of the Comptroller of \\nthe Currency (OCC) and the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau (CFPB) to resolve, among other things, investigations by \\nthe agencies into the Company‚Äôs compliance risk management \\nprogram and its past practices involving certain automobile \\ncollateral protection insurance (CPI) policies and certain \\nmortgage interest rate lock extensions. Shareholders filed a \\nputative securities fraud class action against the Company and its \\nexecutive officers alleging material misstatements and omissions \\nof CPI-related information in the Company‚Äôs public disclosures. In \\nJanuary 2020, the court dismissed this action as to all defendants \\nexcept the Company and a former executive officer and limited \\nthe action to two alleged misstatements. On May 1, 2023, the \\ncourt granted preliminary approval of an agreement pursuant to \\nwhich the Company agreed to pay $300 million to resolve this \\naction. Additionally, a number of other lawsuits were filed by \\nnon-governmental parties seeking damages or other remedies \\nrelated to these CPI policies and related to the unused portion of \\nguaranteed automobile protection (GAP) waiver or insurance \\nagreements. As previously disclosed, the Company entered into \\nvarious settlements to resolve these lawsuits, while others were \\ndismissed. In addition, federal and state government agencies, \\nincluding the CFPB, have undertaken formal or informal inquiries, \\ninvestigations, or examinations regarding these and other issues \\nrelated to the origination, servicing, and collection of consumer \\nauto loans, including related insurance products. On \\nDecember 20, 2022, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the CFPB to resolve the CFPB‚Äôs investigations related to \\nautomobile lending, consumer deposit accounts, and mortgage \\nlending. The consent order requires, among other things, \\nremediation to customers and the payment of a $1.7 billion civil \\npenalty to the CFPB. As previously disclosed, the Company \\nentered into an agreement to resolve investigations by state \\nattorneys general. COMPANY 401(K) PLAN MATTERS Federal government agencies, \\nincluding the United States Department of Labor (Department \\nof Labor), have undertaken reviews of certain transactions \\nassociated with the Employee Stock Ownership Plan feature of \\nthe Company‚Äôs 401(k) plan, including the manner in which the \\n401(k) plan purchased certain securities used in connection with \\nthe Company‚Äôs contributions to the 401(k) plan. As previously \\ndisclosed, the Company entered into an agreement to resolve \\nthe Department of Labor‚Äôs review. On September 26, 2022, \\nparticipants in the Company‚Äôs 401(k) plan filed a putative class \\naction in the United States District Court for the District of \\nMinnesota alleging that the Company violated the Employee \\nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 in connection with \\ncertain of these transactions. \\nCONSENT ORDER DISCLOSURE LITIGATION Wells Fargo \\nshareholders have brought a putative securities fraud class action \\nin the United States District Court for the Southern District of \\nNew York alleging that the Company and certain of its current \\nand former executive officers and directors made false or \\nmisleading statements regarding the Company‚Äôs efforts to \\ncomply with the February 2018 consent order with the Federal \\nReserve Board and the April 2018 consent orders with the CFPB \\nand OCC. On May 16, 2023, the court granted preliminary \\napproval of an agreement pursuant to which the Company \\nagreed to pay $1.0 billion to resolve this action. Allegations \\nrelated to the Company‚Äôs efforts to comply with these three \\nconsent orders are also among the subjects of shareholder \\nderivative lawsuits filed in California state and federal court. \\nHIRING PRACTICES MATTERS Government agencies, including the \\nUnited States Department of Justice and the United States \\nSecurities and Exchange Commission, have undertaken formal or \\ninformal inquiries or investigations regarding the Company‚Äôs \\nhiring practices related to diversity. A putative securities fraud \\nclass action has also been filed in the United States District Court \\nfor the Northern District of California alleging that the Company \\nand certain of its executive officers made false or misleading \\nstatements about the Company‚Äôs hiring practices related to \\ndiversity. Allegations related to the Company‚Äôs hiring practices \\nrelated to diversity are also among the subjects of shareholder \\nderivative lawsuits filed in the United States District Court for \\nthe Northern District of California and in California state court. \\nINTERCHANGE LITIGATION Plaintiffs representing a class of \\nmerchants have filed putative class actions, and individual \\nmerchants have filed individual actions, against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., Wells Fargo & Company, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and \\nWachovia Corporation regarding the interchange fees associated \\nwith Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. Visa, \\nMasterCard, and several other banks and bank holding \\ncompanies are also named as defendants in these actions. These \\nactions have been consolidated in the United States District \\nCourt for the Eastern District of New York. The amended and \\nconsolidated complaint asserts claims against defendants based \\non alleged violations of federal and state antitrust laws and seeks \\ndamages as well as injunctive relief. Plaintiff merchants allege \\nthat Visa, MasterCard, and payment card issuing banks unlawfully \\ncolluded to set interchange rates. Plaintiffs also allege that \\nenforcement of certain Visa and MasterCard rules and alleged \\ntying and bundling of services offered to merchants are \\nanticompetitive.

On July 13, 2012, Visa, MasterCard, and \\nthe financial institution defendants, including Wells Fargo, signed \\na memorandum of understanding with plaintiff merchants to \\nresolve the consolidated class action and reached a separate \\nsettlement in principle of the consolidated individual actions. The \\nsettlement payments to be made by all defendants in the \\nconsolidated class and individual actions totaled approximately \\n$6.6 billion before reductions applicable to certain merchants \\nopting out of the settlement. The class settlement also provided \\nfor the distribution to class merchants of 10 basis points of \\ndefault interchange across all credit rate categories for a period \\nof eight consecutive months. The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants. Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune 30, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November 23, 2016, prior \\nclass counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, \\nseeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second \\nCircuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, \\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead \\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. \\nThe parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve \\nthe damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a \\ntotal of approximately $6.2 billion, which includes approximately \\n$5.3 billion of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and \\n$900 million in additional funding. The Company‚Äôs allocated \\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately \\n$94.5 million. The court granted final approval of the settlement \\non December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector \\nmerchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the \\ndamages class settlement. Settlement objector merchants filed a \\npetition for a rehearing by the Second Circuit en banc, which was \\ndenied. On September 27, 2021, the district court granted the \\nplaintiffs‚Äô motion for class certification in the equitable relief \\ncase. Several of the opt-out and direct action litigations have \\nbeen settled while others remain pending. \\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS The United States Securities \\nand Exchange Commission and the United States Commodity \\nFutures Trading Commission have undertaken investigations \\nregarding the Company‚Äôs compliance with records retention \\nrequirements relating to business communications sent over \\nunapproved electronic messaging channels. The Company is in \\nresolution discussions with these agencies, although there can be \\nno assurance as to the outcome of these discussions. \\nRMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank in New York state court, and Park Royal I \\nLLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state court. In each case, \\nthe plaintiffs allege that Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert causes of action \\nbased upon, among other things, the trustee‚Äôs alleged failure to \\nnotify and enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan \\nsellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, \\nnotify investors of alleged events of default, and abide by \\nappropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. \\nIn July 2022, the district court dismissed Phoenix Light‚Äôs claims \\nand certain of the claims asserted by Commerzbank AG, and \\nsubsequently entered judgment in each case in favor of Wells \\nFargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix Light and \\nCommerzbank AG each appealed the district court‚Äôs decision to \\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \\nPhoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, terminating its \\ncase. The Company previously settled two class actions filed by \\ninstitutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit \\nUnion Administration with similar allegations. \\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor‚Äôs trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case. \\nOUTLOOK As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company‚Äôs accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.5 billion as of June 30, \\n2023. The outcomes of legal actions are unpredictable and \\nsubject to significant uncertainties, and it is inherently difficult to \\ndetermine whether any loss is probable or even possible. It is also \\ninherently difficult to estimate the amount of any loss and there \\nmay be matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably \\npossible but not currently estimable. Accordingly, actual losses \\nmay be in excess of the established accrual or the range of \\nreasonably possible loss. Based on information currently \\navailable, advice of counsel, available insurance coverage, and \\nestablished reserves, Wells Fargo believes that the eventual \\noutcome of the actions against Wells Fargo and/or its \\nsubsidiaries will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on Wells Fargo‚Äôs consolidated financial \\ncondition. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of a \\nmatter, if unfavorable, may be material to Wells Fargo‚Äôs results \\nof operations for any particular period. \\nWells Fargo & Company 97 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nBalance Sheet Offsetting \\nWe execute substantially all of our derivative transactions under \\nmaster netting arrangements. Where legally enforceable, these \\nmaster netting arrangements give the ability, in the event of \\ndefault by the counterparty, to liquidate securities held as \\ncollateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same \\ncounterparty. We reflect all derivative balances and related cash \\ncollateral subject to enforceable master netting arrangements on \\na net basis on our consolidated balance sheet. We do not net \\nnon-cash collateral that we receive or pledge against derivative \\nbalances on our consolidated balance sheet. \\nFor disclosure purposes, we present ‚ÄúTotal Derivatives, net‚Äù \\nwhich represents the aggregate of our net exposure to each \\ncounterparty after considering the balance sheet netting adjustments and any non-cash collateral. We manage derivative \\nexposure by monitoring the credit risk associated with each \\ncounterparty using counterparty-specific credit risk limits, using \\nmaster netting arrangements and obtaining collateral. \\nTable 11.2 provides information on the fair values of \\nderivative assets and liabilities subject to enforceable master \\nnetting arrangements, the balance sheet netting adjustments \\nand the resulting net fair value amount recorded on our \\nconsolidated balance sheet, as well as the non-cash collateral \\nassociated with such arrangements. In addition to the netting \\namounts included in the table, we also have balance sheet netting \\nrelated to resale and repurchase agreements that are disclosed \\nwithin Note 15 (Pledged Assets and Collateral). \\nWells Fargo & Company 98 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

For additional information, see \\nNote 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). \\nFair Value and Cash Flow Hedges \\nFor fair value hedges, we use interest rate swaps to convert \\ncertain of our fixed-rate long-term debt and time certificates of \\ndeposit to floating rates to hedge our exposure to interest rate \\nrisk. We also enter into cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge our exposure \\nto foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated with the \\nissuance of non-U.S. dollar denominated long-term debt. We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use \\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against \\nchanges in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale \\n(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign \\ncurrency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest \\nrate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated \\namounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain \\nfair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of \\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency \\nbasis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20 (Other Comprehensive Income) for the \\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income. \\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans, and interest paid on certain floating-rate debt due to \\nchanges in the contractually specified interest rate. We also use \\ncross-currency swaps to hedge variability in interest payments \\non fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated long-term debt due \\nto changes in foreign exchange rates. \\nWe estimate $947 million pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at June 30, 2023, will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths. For cash flow hedges as of June 30, 2023, we are \\nhedging our interest rate and foreign currency exposure to the \\nvariability of future cash flows for all forecasted transactions for \\na maximum of 9 years. For additional information on our \\naccounting hedges, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K. \\nTable 11.3 and Table 11.4 show the net gains (losses) related \\nto derivatives in cash flow and fair value hedging relationships, \\nrespectively. \\nWells Fargo & Company 99 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We generally use \\ncredit derivatives to assist customers with their risk \\nmanagement objectives by purchasing and selling credit \\nprotection on corporate debt obligations through the use of \\ncredit default swaps or through risk participation swaps to help \\nmanage counterparty exposure. We would be required to \\nperform under the credit derivatives we sold in the event of \\ndefault by the referenced obligors. Events of default include \\nevents such as bankruptcy, capital restructuring or lack of \\nprincipal and/or interest payment. \\nTable 11.7 provides details of sold credit derivatives. \\nTable 11.7: Sold Credit Derivatives \\nNotional amount \\nProtection sold ‚Äì \\nnon-investment \\n(in millions) Protection sold grade \\nJune 30, 2023 \\nCredit default swaps $ 14,273 1,677 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,460 6,250 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 20,733 7,927 \\nDecember 31, 2022 \\nCredit default swaps $ 12,733 1,860 \\nRisk participation swaps 6,728 6,518 \\nTotal credit derivatives $ 19,461 8,378 \\nProtection sold represents the estimated maximum \\nexposure to loss that would be incurred if, upon an event of \\ndefault, the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclined to zero, and does not take into consideration any of \\nrecovery value from the referenced obligation or offset from \\ncollateral held or any economic hedges. \\nThe amounts under non-investment grade represent the \\nnotional amounts of those credit derivatives on which we have a \\nhigher risk of being required to perform under the terms of the \\ncredit derivative and are a function of the underlying assets. We consider the credit risk to be low if the underlying assets \\nunder the credit derivative have an external rating that is \\ninvestment grade. If an external rating is not available, we classify \\nthe credit derivative as non-investment grade. \\nOur maximum exposure to sold credit derivatives is \\nmanaged through posted collateral and purchased credit \\nderivatives with identical or similar reference positions in order \\nto achieve our desired credit risk profile. The credit risk \\nmanagement is designed to provide an ability to recover a \\nsignificant portion of any amounts that would be paid under sold \\ncredit derivatives. \\nCredit-Risk Contingent Features \\nCertain of our derivative contracts contain provisions whereby if \\nthe credit rating of our debt were to be downgraded by certain \\nmajor credit rating agencies, the counterparty could demand \\nadditional collateral or require termination or replacement of \\nderivative instruments in a net liability position.

Assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a \\nrecurring basis, such as derivatives, residential MSRs, and trading \\nor AFS debt securities, are presented in Table 12.1 in this Note. \\nAdditionally, from time to time, we record fair value adjustments \\non a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring adjustments \\ntypically involve application of lower of cost or fair value \\n(LOCOM) accounting, write-downs of individual assets or \\napplication of the measurement alternative for nonmarketable \\nequity securities. Assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring \\nbasis are presented in Table 12.4 in this Note. We provide in \\nTable 12.9 estimates of fair value for financial instruments that \\nare not recorded at fair value, such as loans and debt liabilities \\ncarried at amortized cost. \\nSee Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in \\nour 2022 Form 10-K for discussion of how we determine fair \\nvalue. For descriptions of the valuation methodologies we use for \\nassets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring or \\nnonrecurring basis, see Note 15 (Fair Values of Assets and \\nLiabilities) in our 2022 Form 10-K. FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY We classify our assets and liabilities \\nrecorded at fair value as either Level 1, 2, or 3 in the fair value \\nhierarchy. The highest priority (Level 1) is assigned to valuations \\nbased on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the \\nlowest priority (Level 3) is assigned to valuations based on \\nsignificant unobservable inputs. See Note 1 (Summary of \\nSignificant Accounting Policies) in our 2022 Form 10-K for a \\ndetailed description of the fair value hierarchy. \\nIn the determination of the classification of financial \\ninstruments in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, we \\nconsider all available information, including observable market \\ndata, indications of market liquidity and orderliness, and our \\nunderstanding of the valuation techniques and significant inputs \\nused. This determination is ultimately based upon the specific \\nfacts and circumstances of each instrument or instrument \\ncategory and judgments are made regarding the significance of \\nthe unobservable inputs to the instruments‚Äô fair value \\nmeasurement in its entirety. If unobservable inputs are \\nconsidered significant, the instrument is classified as Level 3. \\nWe do not classify nonmarketable equity securities in the \\nfair value hierarchy if we use the non-published net asset value \\n(NAV) per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient to \\nmeasure fair value.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include: \\n‚Ä¢ underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities; \\n‚Ä¢ providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees; \\n‚Ä¢ entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and \\n‚Ä¢ providing seller financing to VIEs. \\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity \\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell originated and purchased residential \\nand commercial mortgage loans to government-sponsored \\nentities (GSEs). These loans are generally transferred into \\nsecuritizations sponsored by the GSEs, which provide certain \\ncredit guarantees to investors and servicers. We also transfer \\nmortgage loans into securitization pools pursuant to \\nGovernment National Mortgage Association (GNMA) guidelines \\nwhich are insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \\nor guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \\nMortgage loans eligible for securitization with the GSEs or \\nGNMA are considered conforming loans. The GSEs or GNMA \\ndesign the structure of these securitizations, sponsor the \\ninvolved VIEs, and have power over the activities most significant \\nto the VIE. \\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option to repurchase loans from GNMA loan securitization pools, which \\nbecomes exercisable when three scheduled loan payments \\nremain unpaid by the borrower. When we do not repurchase \\nthese loans, they are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet \\nand pledged to the GNMA securitization. We repurchased loans \\nof $99 million and $191 million, during the second quarter and \\nfirst half of 2023, respectively, and $564 million and $1.5 billion \\nduring the second quarter and first half of 2022, respectively. In \\n2022, these predominantly represented repurchases of \\ngovernment insured loans. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, \\n2022, we recorded assets and related liabilities of $940 million \\nand $743 million, respectively, where we did not exercise our \\noption to repurchase eligible loans. \\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, our \\nliability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was \\n$162 million and $167 million, respectively, and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $13.8 billion at both June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022. \\nSubstantially all residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to GSE and GNMA securitizations. See Note 6 \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming residential and \\ncommercial mortgage loans in securitization transactions that \\nwe design and sponsor. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, \\nand accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit \\nrisk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We \\ntypically originate the transferred loans and account for the \\ntransfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the \\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, \\nsuch as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our \\nservicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage \\nloan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We \\ndo not consolidate the VIE because the most significant \\ndecisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally \\nmade by the special servicer or the controlling class security \\nholder. For our residential nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations accounted for as sales, we either do not hold \\nvariable interests that we consider potentially significant or are \\nnot the primary servicer for a majority of the VIE assets. \\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs. \\nTable 13.1 presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2.

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This \\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or \\nrisk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the \\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities \\nissued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA.

For additional information \\nabout these VIEs, see the ‚ÄúLoan Sales and Securitization Activity‚Äù \\nsection within this Note. Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations also include commercial mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations sponsored by third parties where we did not \\noriginate or transfer the loans but serve as master servicer and \\ninvest in securities that could be potentially significant to the \\nVIE. \\nConforming loan securitization and resecuritization \\ntransactions involving the GSEs and GNMA are excluded from \\nTable 13.4 because we are not the sponsor or we do not have \\npower over the activities most significant to the VIEs. \\nAdditionally, due to the nature of the guarantees provided by the \\nGSEs and the FHA and VA, our credit risk associated with these \\nVIEs is limited. For additional information about conforming \\nmortgage loan securitizations and resecuritizations, see the \\n‚ÄúLoan Sales and Securitization Activity‚Äù and ‚ÄúResecuritization \\nActivities‚Äù sections within this Note. \\nCOMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS We may transfer purchased \\nindustrial development bonds and GSE credit enhancements to \\nVIEs in exchange for beneficial interests. We may also acquire \\nsuch beneficial interests in transactions where we do not act as a \\ntransferor. We own all of the beneficial interests and may also \\nservice the underlying mortgages that serve as collateral to the \\nbonds. The GSEs have the power to direct the servicing and \\nworkout activities of the VIE in the event of a default, therefore \\nwe do not have control over the key decisions of the VIEs. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES We engage in various forms of \\nstructured finance arrangements with other VIEs, including \\nasset-backed finance structures and other securitizations \\ncollateralized by asset classes other than mortgages. Collateral \\nmay include rental properties, asset-backed securities, student \\nloans and mortgage loans. We may participate in structuring or \\nmarketing the arrangements as well as provide financing, service \\none or more of the underlying assets, or enter into derivatives \\nwith the VIEs. We may also receive fees for those services. We \\nare not the primary beneficiary of these structures because we \\ndo not have power to direct the most significant activities of the \\nVIEs. Table 13.4 provides a summary of our exposure to the \\nunconsolidated VIEs described above, which includes \\ninvestments in securities, loans, guarantees, liquidity \\nagreements, commitments and certain derivatives. We exclude \\ncertain transactions with unconsolidated VIEs when our \\ncontinuing involvement is temporary or administrative in nature \\nor insignificant in size. \\nIn Table 13.4, ‚ÄúTotal VIE assets‚Äù represents the remaining \\nprincipal balance of assets held by unconsolidated VIEs using the \\nmost current information available. ‚ÄúCarrying value‚Äù is the \\namount in our consolidated balance sheet related to our \\ninvolvement with the unconsolidated VIEs. ‚ÄúMaximum exposure \\nto loss‚Äù is determined as the carrying value of our investment in \\nthe VIEs excluding the unconditional repurchase options that \\nhave not been exercised, plus the remaining undrawn liquidity \\nand lending commitments, the notional amount of net written \\nderivative contracts, and generally the notional amount of, or \\nstressed loss estimate for, other commitments and guarantees. \\nDebt, guarantees and other commitments include amounts \\nrelated to lending arrangements, liquidity agreements, and \\ncertain loss sharing obligations associated with loans originated, \\nsold, and serviced under certain GSE programs. \\n‚ÄúMaximum exposure to loss‚Äù represents estimated loss that \\nwould be incurred under severe, hypothetical circumstances, for \\nwhich we believe the possibility is extremely remote, such as \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero, without any consideration of recovery or offset \\nfrom any economic hedges.

The \\nprojects are typically managed by third-party sponsors who have \\nthe power over the VIE‚Äôs assets, therefore, we do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs. The carrying value of our equity investments in tax \\ncredit VIEs was $19.0 billion and $18.7 billion at June 30, 2023, \\nand December 31, 2022, respectively. We also had loans to tax \\ncredit VIEs with a carrying value of $2.0 billion at both June 30, \\n2023, and December 31, 2022. \\nOur maximum exposure to loss for tax credit VIEs at \\nJune 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, was $29.7 billion and \\n$28.0 billion, respectively. Our maximum exposure to loss \\nincluded total unfunded equity and lending commitments of \\n$8.8 billion and $7.3 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, \\n2022, respectively. See Note 14 (Guarantees and Other \\nCommitments) for additional information about commitments \\nto purchase equity securities. \\nOur affordable housing equity investments qualify for the \\nlow-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). For additional \\ninformation on our LIHTC investments, see Note 16 \\n(Securitizations and Variable Interest Entities) in our 2022 \\nForm 10-K. Consolidated VIEs \\nWe consolidate VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. We \\nare the primary beneficiary of the following structure types: \\nCOMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL LOANS AND LEASES We may \\nsecuritize dealer floor plan loans in a revolving master trust \\nentity. As servicer and residual interest holder, we control the key \\ndecisions of the trust and consolidate the entity. The total VIE \\nassets held by the master trust represent a majority of the total \\nVIE assets presented for this category in Table 13.5. In a separate \\ntransaction structure, we may provide the majority of debt and \\nequity financing to an SPE that engages in lending and leasing to \\nspecific vendors and service the underlying collateral. \\nOTHER VIE STRUCTURES Other VIEs are predominantly related to \\nmunicipal tender option bond (MTOB) transactions. MTOBs are \\nvehicles to finance the purchase of municipal bonds through the \\nissuance of short-term debt to investors. Our involvement with \\nMTOBs includes serving as the residual interest holder, which \\nprovides control over the key decisions of the VIE, as well as the \\nremarketing agent or liquidity provider related to the debt issued \\nto investors. We may also securitize nonconforming mortgage \\nloans, in which our involvement includes servicer of the \\nunderlying assets and holder of subordinate or senior securities \\nissued by the VIE. During second quarter 2022, we purchased the \\noutstanding mortgage loans from the VIEs and extinguished the \\nrelated debt associated with such securitizations. \\nWells Fargo & Company 118 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Estimated maximum exposure to loss was $172 million and $157 million with related collateral of $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion \\nas of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. \\nMaximum exposure to loss represents the estimated loss \\nthat would be incurred under an assumed hypothetical \\ncircumstance, despite what we believe is a remote possibility, \\nwhere the value of our interests and any associated collateral \\ndeclines to zero. Maximum exposure to loss estimates in \\nTable 14.1 do not reflect economic hedges or collateral we could \\nuse to offset or recover losses we may incur under our guarantee \\nagreements. Accordingly, these amounts are not an indication of \\nexpected loss. We believe the carrying value is more \\nrepresentative of our current exposure to loss than maximum \\nexposure to loss. The carrying value represents the fair value of \\nthe guarantee, if any, and also includes an ACL for guarantees, if \\napplicable. In determining the ACL for guarantees, we consider \\nthe credit risk of the related contingent obligation. \\nFor our guarantees in Table 14.1, non-investment grade \\nrepresents those guarantees on which we have a higher risk of \\nperformance under the terms of the guarantee, which is \\ndetermined based on an external rating or an internal credit \\ngrade that is below investment grade. \\nWRITTEN OPTIONS We enter into written foreign currency \\noptions and over-the-counter written equity put options that are \\nderivative contracts that have the characteristics of a guarantee. \\nThe fair value of written options represents our view of the \\nprobability that we will be required to perform under the \\ncontract. The fair value of these written options was an asset of \\n$449 million and a liability of $15 million at June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively. The fair value may be an asset \\nas a result of deferred premiums on certain option trades. The \\nmaximum exposure to loss represents the notional value of these \\nderivative contracts. At June 30, 2023, the maximum exposure \\nto loss was $31.8 billion, with $29.3 billion expiring in three years \\nor less compared with $23.4 billion and $21.3 billion, respectively, at December 31, 2022. See Note 11 (Derivatives) \\nfor additional information regarding written derivative contracts. \\nREPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES We record a liability for \\nmortgage loans that we expect to repurchase pursuant to various \\nrepresentations or warranties. See Note 13 (Securitizations and \\nVariable Interest Entities) for further discussion and related \\namounts. Additionally, when we sell MSRs, we may provide \\nindemnifications for losses incurred due to material breaches of \\ncontractual representations or warranties as well as other \\nrecourse arrangements. At June 30, 2023, our liability for these \\nindemnification arrangements was $8 million and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $650 million, with $609 million expiring in \\nthree years or less. \\nMERCHANT PROCESSING SERVICES We provide debit and credit \\ncard transaction processing services through payment networks \\ndirectly for merchants and as a sponsor for merchant processing \\nservicers, including our joint venture with a third party that is \\naccounted for as an equity method investment. In our role as the \\nmerchant acquiring bank, we have a potential obligation in \\nconnection with payment and delivery disputes between the \\nmerchant and the cardholder that are resolved in favor of the \\ncardholder, referred to as a charge-back transaction. We \\nestimate our potential maximum exposure to be the total \\nmerchant transaction volume processed in the preceding four \\nmonths, which is generally the lifecycle for a charge-back \\ntransaction. As of June 30, 2023, our potential maximum \\nexposure was approximately $789.5 billion, and related losses, \\nincluding those from our joint venture entity, were insignificant. \\nWells Fargo & Company 120 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

These activities are \\nconducted through our broker-dealer subsidiaries and, to a lesser \\nextent, through other bank entities. Our securities financing \\nactivities primarily involve high-quality, liquid securities such as \\nU.S. Treasury securities and government agency securities and, \\nto a lesser extent, less liquid securities, including equity \\nsecurities, corporate bonds and asset-backed securities. We \\naccount for these transactions as collateralized financings in \\nwhich we typically receive or pledge securities as collateral. We \\nbelieve these financing transactions generally do not have \\nmaterial credit risk given the collateral provided and the related \\nmonitoring processes. We also enter into resale agreements involving collateral other than securities, such as loans, as part of \\nour commercial lending business activities. \\nOFFSETTING OF SECURITIES AND OTHER COLLATERALIZED \\nFINANCING ACTIVITIES Table 15.2 presents resale and repurchase \\nagreements subject to master repurchase agreements (MRA) \\nand securities borrowing and lending agreements subject to \\nmaster securities lending agreements (MSLA). Where legally \\nenforceable, these master netting arrangements give the ability, \\nin the event of default by the counterparty, to liquidate securities \\nheld as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the \\nsame counterparty. Collateralized financings, and those with a \\nsingle counterparty, are presented net on our consolidated \\nbalance sheet, provided certain criteria are met that permit \\nbalance sheet netting.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \\nobligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction‚Äôs \\nmaturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1) the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \\namounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. We define our \\nreportable operating segments by type of product and customer \\nsegment, and their results are based on our management \\nreporting process. The management reporting process measures \\nthe performance of the reportable operating segments based on \\nthe Company‚Äôs management structure, and the results are \\nregularly reviewed with our Chief Executive Officer and relevant \\nsenior management. The management reporting process is \\nbased on U.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as \\nfunds transfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared \\nrevenue and expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments. \\nConsumer Banking and Lending offers diversified financial \\nproducts and services for consumers and small businesses with \\nannual sales generally up to $10 million. These financial products \\nand services include checking and savings accounts, credit and \\ndebit cards as well as home, auto, personal, and small business \\nlending. \\nCommercial Banking provides financial solutions to private, \\nfamily owned and certain public companies. Products and \\nservices include banking and credit products across multiple \\nindustry sectors and municipalities, secured lending and lease \\nproducts, and treasury management. \\nCorporate and Investment Banking delivers a suite of capital \\nmarkets, banking, and financial products and services to \\ncorporate, commercial real estate, government and institutional \\nclients globally. Products and services include corporate banking, \\ninvestment banking, treasury management, commercial real \\nestate lending and servicing, equity and fixed income solutions as \\nwell as sales, trading, and research capabilities. \\nWealth and Investment Management provides personalized \\nwealth management, brokerage, financial planning, lending, \\nprivate banking, trust and fiduciary products and services to \\naffluent, high-net worth and ultra-high-net worth clients. We \\noperate through financial advisors in our brokerage and wealth \\noffices, consumer bank branches, independent offices, and \\ndigitally through WellsTrade ¬Æ and Intuitive Investor ¬Æ. Corporate includes corporate treasury and enterprise functions, \\nnet of allocations (including funds transfer pricing, capital, \\nliquidity and certain expenses), in support of the reportable \\noperating segments as well as our investment portfolio and \\naffiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. \\nCorporate also includes certain lines of business that \\nmanagement has determined are no longer consistent with the \\nlong-term strategic goals of the Company as well as results for \\npreviously divested businesses. \\nBasis of Presentation \\nFUNDS TRANSFER PRICING Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury. \\nREVENUE AND EXPENSE SHARING When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements. \\nWhen a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided. \\nTAXABLE-EQUIVALENT ADJUSTMENTS Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company‚Äôs \\nconsolidated financial results. \\nWells Fargo & Company 125 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

See the ‚ÄúGlossary of Acronyms‚Äù for definitions of terms used \\nthroughout this Report. \\xa0\\nFinancial Review\\nOverview\\nWells\\xa0Fargo & Company is a leading financial services company \\nthat has approximately $1.9 trillion  in assets, proudly serves one \\nin three U.S. households and more than 10% of small businesses \\nin the U.S., and is a leading middle market banking provider in the \\nU.S. We provide a diversified set of banking, investment and \\nmortgage products and services, as well as consumer and \\ncommercial finance, through our four reportable operating \\nsegments: Consumer Banking and Lending, Commercial Banking, \\nCorporate and Investment Banking, and Wealth and Investment \\nManagement. Wells Fargo ranked No. 47 on Fortune‚Äôs\\xa0 2023 \\nrankings of America‚Äôs largest corporations. We ranked fourth in \\nassets and third in the market value of our common stock among \\nall U.S. banks at September\\xa030, 2023 .\\xa0\\nWells Fargo‚Äôs top priority remains building a risk and control \\ninfrastructure appropriate for its size and complexity. The \\nCompany is subject to a number of consent orders and other \\nregulatory actions, which may require the Company, among \\nother things, to undertake certain changes to its business, \\noperations, products and services, and risk management \\npractices. Addressing these regulatory actions is expected to \\ntake multiple years, and we are likely to continue to experience \\nissues or delays along the way in satisfying their requirements. \\nWe are also likely to continue to identify more issues as we \\nimplement our risk and control infrastructure, which may result \\nin additional regulatory actions. Issues or delays with one \\nregulatory action could affect our progress on others, and \\nregulators have indicated the potential for escalating \\nconsequences for banks that do not timely resolve open issues. \\nFailure to satisfy the requirements of a regulatory action on a \\ntimely basis could result in additional penalties, business \\nrestrictions, limitations on subsidiary capital distributions, \\nincreased capital or liquidity requirements, enforcement actions, \\nand other negative consequences, which could be significant. \\nWhile we still have significant work to do and have not yet \\nsatisfied certain aspects of these regulatory actions, the \\nCompany is committed to devoting the resources necessary to \\noperate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the \\nhighest level of integrity, and have an appropriate culture in \\nplace.\\nFederal Reserve Board Consent Order Regarding \\nGovernance Oversight and Compliance and Operational \\nRisk Management\\nOn February 2, 2018, the Company entered into a consent order \\nwith the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System \\n(FRB). As required by the consent order, the Company‚Äôs Board of \\nDirectors (Board) submitted to the FRB a plan to further enhance \\nthe Board‚Äôs governance and oversight of the Company, and the \\nCompany submitted to the FRB a plan to further improve the Company‚Äôs compliance and operational risk management \\nprogram. The Company continues to engage with the FRB as the \\nCompany works to address the consent order provisions. The \\nconsent order also requires the Company, following the FRB‚Äôs \\nacceptance and approval of the plans and the Company‚Äôs \\nadoption and implementation of the plans, to complete an initial \\nthird-party review of the enhancements and improvements \\nprovided for in the plans. Until this third-party review is complete \\nand the plans are approved and implemented to the satisfaction \\nof the FRB, the Company‚Äôs total consolidated assets as defined \\nunder the consent order will be limited to the level as of \\nDecember 31, 2017. Compliance with this asset cap is measured \\non a two-quarter daily average basis to allow for management of \\ntemporary fluctuations. After removal of the asset cap, a second \\nthird-party review must also be conducted to assess the efficacy \\nand sustainability of the enhancements and improvements.\\nConsent Orders with the Consumer Financial Protection \\nBureau and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \\nRegarding Compliance Risk Management Program, \\nAutomobile Collateral Protection Insurance Policies, and \\nMortgage Interest Rate Lock Extensions\\nOn April 20, 2018, the Company entered into consent orders \\nwith the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and the \\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) to pay an \\naggregate of $1 billion in civil money penalties to resolve matters \\nregarding the Company‚Äôs compliance risk management program \\nand past practices involving certain automobile collateral \\nprotection insurance (CPI) policies and certain mortgage interest \\nrate lock extensions. As required by the consent orders, the \\nCompany submitted to the CFPB and OCC an enterprise-wide \\ncompliance risk management plan and a plan to enhance the \\nCompany‚Äôs internal audit program with respect to federal \\nconsumer financial law and the terms of the consent orders. In \\naddition, as required by the consent orders, the Company \\nsubmitted for non-objection plans to remediate customers \\naffected by the automobile collateral protection insurance and \\nmortgage interest rate lock matters, as well as a plan for the \\nmanagement of remediation activities conducted by the \\nCompany. The Company continues to work to address the \\nprovisions of the consent orders. On September 9, 2021, the \\nOCC assessed a $250 million civil money penalty against the \\nCompany related to insufficient progress in addressing \\nrequirements under the OCC‚Äôs April 2018 consent order and loss \\nmitigation activities in the Company‚Äôs Home Lending business. \\nOn December 20, 2022, the CFPB modified its consent order to \\nclarify how it would terminate.\\nWells Fargo & Company 3', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The required actions related \\nto many of these matters were already substantially complete at \\nthe time we entered into the consent order, and the consent \\norder lays out a path to termination after the Company \\ncompletes the remainder of the required actions.\\nRetail Sales Practices Matters\\nIn September 2016, we announced settlements with the CFPB, \\nthe OCC, and the Office of the Los Angeles City Attorney, and \\nentered into related consent orders with the CFPB and the OCC, \\nin connection with allegations that some of our retail customers \\nreceived products and services they did not request. As a result, it \\nremains a priority to rebuild trust through a comprehensive \\naction plan that includes making things right for our customers, \\nemployees, and other stakeholders, and building a better \\nCompany for the future. On September 8, 2021, the CFPB \\nconsent order regarding retail sales practices expired.\\nFor additional information regarding retail sales practices \\nmatters, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk \\nFactors‚Äù section in our 2022 Form\\xa010-K .\\nCustomer Remediation Activities\\nOur priority of rebuilding trust has included an effort to identify \\nareas or instances where customers may have experienced \\nfinancial harm, provide remediation as appropriate, and \\nimplement additional operational and control procedures. We are \\nworking with our regulatory agencies in this effort.\\nWe have accrued for the probable and estimable costs \\nrelated to our customer remediation activities, which amounts \\nmay change based on additional facts and information, as well as \\nongoing reviews and communications with our regulators. We \\nhad approximately $1.5 billion and approximately $2.3 billion of \\naccrued liabilities for customer remediation activities as of \\nSeptember 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. As \\nour ongoing reviews continue and as we continue to strengthen \\nour risk and control infrastructure, we have identified and may in \\nthe future identify additional items or areas of potential concern. \\nTo the extent issues are identified, we will continue to assess any \\ncustomer harm and provide remediation as appropriate. We have \\npreviously disclosed key areas of focus as part of these activities. \\nFor additional information regarding these activities, including related legal and regulatory risk, see the ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù \\nsection in our 2022 Form\\xa010-K .\\nRecent Developments\\nDebit Card Interchange Fees\\nOn October 25, 2023, the FRB issued a proposed rule that would \\nreduce the amount of debit card interchange fees received by \\ndebit card issuers. In addition, the proposed rule would allow for \\nan update to the debit card interchange fee cap every other year \\nbased on an analysis of certain costs incurred by debit card \\nissuers. Based on a preliminary assessment, we expect a \\nsignificant reduction to our debit card interchange fees, which \\nare included in card fees, if the rule is adopted as currently \\nproposed.\\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation Special Assessment\\nIn May 2023, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \\nproposed a rule to recover by special assessment losses to the \\nFDIC deposit insurance fund as a result of bank failures in the \\nfirst half of 2023. Under the proposed rule, the FDIC would \\ncollect a special assessment based on a calculation using an \\ninsured depository institution‚Äôs estimated amount of uninsured \\ndeposits. As currently proposed, the amount of our special \\nassessment may be up to $1.8 billion (pre-tax). We expect to \\nexpense the entire amount upon the FDIC‚Äôs finalization of the \\nrule, which we expect to occur in fourth quarter 2023. The \\nproposed rule may be changed prior to finalization and any \\nchanges may affect the timing or amount of the special \\nassessment.\\nCapital Matters\\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a proposed \\nrule that would impact the way in which risk-based capital \\nrequirements are determined for certain banks. The proposed \\nrule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach and replace \\nit with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \\naddress the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \\nand capital optimization strategies.\\nFor additional information about capital planning, see the \\n‚ÄúCapital Management ‚Äì Capital Planning and Stress Testing‚Äù \\nsection in this Report.\\nFinancial Performance\\nAdoption of Accounting Standards Update 2018-12\\nIn first quarter 2023, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards \\nBoard (FASB) Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2018-12 ‚Äì \\nFinancial Services ‚Äì Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted \\nImprovements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts . \\nWe adopted this ASU with retrospective application, which \\nrequired revision of prior period financial statements.

All other business \\nactivities that are not included in the reportable operating \\nsegments have been included in Corporate. For additional \\ninformation, see Table 5 . We define our reportable operating \\nsegments by type of product and customer segment, and their \\nresults are based on our management reporting process. The \\nmanagement reporting process measures the performance of \\nthe reportable operating segments based on the Company‚Äôs \\nmanagement structure, and the results are regularly reviewed \\nwith our Chief Executive Officer and relevant senior \\nmanagement. The management reporting process is based on \\nU.S. GAAP and includes specific adjustments, such as funds \\ntransfer pricing for asset/liability management, shared revenue \\nand expenses, and taxable-equivalent adjustments to \\nconsistently reflect income from taxable and tax-exempt \\nsources, which allows management to assess performance \\nconsistently across the operating segments.\\nFunds Transfer Pricing  Corporate treasury manages a funds \\ntransfer pricing methodology that considers interest rate risk, \\nliquidity risk, and other product characteristics. Operating \\nsegments pay a funding charge for their assets and receive a \\nfunding credit for their deposits, both of which are included in \\nnet interest income. The net impact of the funding charges or \\ncredits is recognized in corporate treasury.\\nRevenue and Expense Sharing   When lines of business jointly \\nserve customers, the line of business that is responsible for \\nproviding the product or service recognizes revenue or expense \\nwith a referral fee paid or an allocation of cost to the other line of \\nbusiness based on established internal revenue-sharing \\nagreements.When a line of business uses a service provided by another \\nline of business or enterprise function (included in Corporate), \\nexpense is generally allocated based on the cost and use of the \\nservice provided.\\nTaxable-Equivalent Adjustments  Taxable-equivalent \\nadjustments related to tax-exempt income on certain loans and \\ndebt securities are included in net interest income, while taxable-\\nequivalent adjustments related to income tax credits for low-\\nincome housing and renewable energy investments are included \\nin noninterest income, in each case with corresponding impacts \\nto income tax expense (benefit). Adjustments are included in \\nCorporate, Commercial Banking, and Corporate and Investment \\nBanking and are eliminated to reconcile to the Company‚Äôs \\nconsolidated financial results.\\nAllocated Capital  Reportable operating segments are allocated \\ncapital under a risk-sensitive framework that is primarily based \\non aspects of our regulatory capital requirements, and the \\nassumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are \\nperiodically assessed and revised. Effective January\\xa01, 2023, \\nmanagement modified its capital allocation methodology to \\nimprove alignment of allocated capital with the binding \\nregulatory constraints of the Company. Management believes \\nthat return on allocated capital is a useful financial measure \\nbecause it enables management, investors, and others to assess \\na reportable operating segment‚Äôs use of capital.\\nSelected Metrics   We present certain financial and nonfinancial \\nmetrics that management uses when evaluating reportable \\noperating segment results. Management believes that these \\nmetrics are useful to investors and others to assess the \\nperformance, customer growth, and trends of reportable \\noperating segments or lines of business.\\nTable 5:   Management Reporting Structure\\nWells Fargo & Company\\nConsumer \\nBanking and \\nLendingCommercial \\nBankingCorporate and \\nInvestment \\nBankingWealth and \\nInvestment \\nManagementCorporate\\n‚Ä¢ Consumer, Small \\nand Business \\nBanking\\n‚Ä¢ Home Lending\\n‚Ä¢ Credit Card\\n‚Ä¢ Auto\\n‚Ä¢ Personal Lending‚Ä¢ Middle Market \\nBanking\\n‚Ä¢ Asset-Based \\nLending and Leasing‚Ä¢ Banking\\n‚Ä¢ Commercial Real \\nEstate\\n‚Ä¢ Markets‚Ä¢ Wells Fargo \\nAdvisors\\n‚Ä¢ The Private\\nBank‚Ä¢ Corporate \\nTreasury\\n‚Ä¢ Enterprise \\nFunctions\\n‚Ä¢ Investment \\nPortfolio\\n‚Ä¢ Venture capital \\nand private equity \\ninvestments\\n‚Ä¢ Non-strategic \\nbusinessesEarnings Performance  (continued)\\n12 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

See Note 6  (Mortgage Banking Activities ) \\nto Financial Statements in this Report for additional information \\nabout residential and commercial servicing rights, servicer \\nadvances and servicing fees.\\nIn accordance with applicable servicing guidelines , upon \\ntransfer  as servicer, we have the option to repurchase loans from \\ncertain loan securitizations, which generally becomes exercisable \\nbased on delinquency status such as when three scheduled loan \\npayments are past due. When we have the unilateral option to \\nrepurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and a corresponding \\nliability on our balance sheet regardless of our intent to \\nrepurchase the loan.

We are subject to interest rate risk because:\\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may mature or reprice at different \\ntimes. If assets reprice faster than liabilities and interest \\nrates are generally rising, earnings will initially increase or \\nwhen interest rates are generally falling, earnings will initially \\ndecrease;\\n‚Ä¢ assets and liabilities may reprice at the same time but by \\ndifferent amounts;\\n‚Ä¢ short-term and long-term market interest rates may change \\nby different amounts. For example, the shape of the yield \\ncurve may affect yield for new loans and funding costs \\ndifferently;\\n‚Ä¢ the remaining maturity for various assets or liabilities may \\nshorten or lengthen as interest rates change. For example, if \\nlong-term mortgage interest rates increase sharply, \\nmortgage-related products may pay down at a slower rate \\nthan anticipated, which could impact portfolio income; or\\n‚Ä¢ interest rates may have a direct or indirect effect on loan \\ndemand, collateral values, credit losses, mortgage \\norigination volume, and the fair value of MSRs and other \\nfinancial instruments. \\nWe assess interest rate risk by comparing outcomes under \\nvarious net interest income simulations using many interest rate \\nscenarios that differ in the direction of interest rate changes, the \\ndegree of change over time, the speed of change and the \\nprojected shape of the yield curve. These simulations require \\nassumptions regarding drivers of earnings and balance sheet \\ncomposition such as loan originations, prepayment rates on loans \\nand debt securities, deposit flows and mix, as well as pricing \\nstrategies.\\nOur most recent simulations, as presented in Table 24 , \\nestimate net interest income sensitivity over the next 12 months \\nusing instantaneous movements across the yield curve with both \\nlower and higher interest rates relative to our base scenario. \\nSteeper and flatter scenarios measure non-parallel changes in \\nthe yield curve, with long-term interest rates defined as all tenors \\nthree years and longer and short-term interest rates defined as \\nall tenors less than three years. Where applicable, U.S. dollar \\ninterest rates are floored at 0.00%. The following describes the \\nsimulation assumptions for the scenarios presented in Table 24 :\\n‚Ä¢ Simulations are dynamic and reflect anticipated changes to \\nour assets and liabilities.\\n‚Ä¢ Other macroeconomic variables that could be correlated \\nwith the changes in interest rates are held constant.\\n‚Ä¢ Mortgage prepayment and origination assumptions vary \\nacross scenarios and reflect only the impact of the higher or \\nlower interest rates.\\nWells Fargo & Company 39', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

See the ‚ÄúRisk \\nManagement ‚Äì Asset/Liability Management ‚Äì Mortgage Banking \\nInterest Rate and Market Risk‚Äù section in our 2022 Form\\xa010-K  \\nfor additional information.\\nInterest rate sensitive noninterest income is also impacted \\nby changes in earnings credit for noninterest-bearing deposits \\nthat reduce treasury management deposit-related service fees \\non commercial accounts, and by trading assets. In addition, the \\nimpact to net interest income does not include the fair value \\nchanges of trading securities, which, along with the effects of \\nrelated economic hedges, are recorded in noninterest income. In \\naddition to changes in interest rates, net interest income and \\nnoninterest income from trading securities may be impacted by \\nthe actual composition of the trading portfolio. For additional information on our trading assets and liabilities, see Note 2  \\n(Trading Activities ) to Financial Statements in this Report. \\nWe use the debt securities portfolio and exchange-traded \\nand over-the-counter (OTC) interest rate derivatives to manage \\nour interest rate exposures. As interest rates increase, changes in \\nthe fair value of AFS debt securities may negatively affect \\naccumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), which lowers \\nthe amount of our regulatory capital. AOCI also includes \\nunrealized gains or losses related to the transfer of debt \\nsecurities from AFS to HTM, which are subsequently amortized \\ninto earnings over the life of the security with no further impact \\nfrom interest rate changes. See Note 1  (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies ) and Note 3  (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-\\nMaturity Debt Securities ) to Financial Statements in this Report \\nfor additional information on the debt securities portfolios. We \\nuse derivatives for asset/liability management in the following \\nmain ways:\\n‚Ä¢ to convert the cash flows from selected asset and/or liability \\ninstruments/portfolios including certain interest-earning \\ndeposits, commercial loans and long-term debt, from \\nfloating-rate payments to fixed-rate payments, or vice \\nversa;\\n‚Ä¢ to reduce AOCI sensitivity of our AFS debt securities \\nportfolio; and\\n‚Ä¢ to economically hedge our mortgage origination pipeline, \\nfunded mortgage loans, and MSRs.\\nDerivatives used to hedge our interest rate risk exposures \\nare presented in Note 11  (Derivatives ) to Financial Statements in \\nthis Report. \\nMORTGAGE BANKING INTEREST RATE AND MARKET RISK\\xa0  We \\noriginate and service mortgage loans, which subjects us to \\nvarious risks, including market, interest rate, credit, and liquidity \\nrisks that can be substantial. Based on market conditions and \\nother factors, we reduce credit and liquidity risks by selling or \\nsecuritizing mortgage loans. We determine whether mortgage \\nloans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of \\ncommitment, but may change our intent to hold loans for \\ninvestment or sale as part of our corporate asset/liability \\nmanagement activities. We may also retain securities in our \\ninvestment portfolio at the time we securitize mortgage loans.\\nChanges in interest rates may impact mortgage banking \\nnoninterest income, including origination and servicing fees, and \\nthe fair value of our residential MSRs, LHFS, and derivative loan \\ncommitments (interest rate ‚Äúlocks‚Äù) extended to mortgage \\napplicants. Interest rate changes will generally impact our \\nmortgage banking noninterest income on a lagging basis due to \\nthe time it takes for the market to reflect a shift in customer \\ndemand, as well as the time required for processing a new \\napplication, providing the commitment, and securitizing and \\nselling the loan. The amount and timing of the impact will depend \\non the magnitude, speed and duration of the changes in interest \\nrates.

These trading activities \\npredominantly  occur within our CIB businesses and, to a lesser \\nextent, other businesses of the Company. Debt securities held \\nfor trading, equity securities held for trading, trading loans, and \\ntrading derivatives are financial instruments used in our trading \\nactivities, and all are carried at fair value.

For \\nadditional information, see Note 4  (Equity Securities ) to Financial \\nStatements in this Report.\\nChanges in equity market prices may also indirectly affect \\nour net income by (1) the value of third-party assets under \\nmanagement and, hence, fee income, (2) borrowers whose ability \\nto repay principal and/or interest may be affected by the stock \\nmarket, or (3) brokerage activity, related commission income and \\nother business activities. Each business line monitors and \\nmanages these indirect risks.LIQUIDITY RISK AND FUNDING   Liquidity risk is the risk arising from \\nthe inability of the Company to meet obligations when they \\ncome due, or roll over funds at a reasonable cost, without \\nincurring heightened costs. In the ordinary course of business, we \\nenter into contractual obligations that may require future cash \\npayments, including funding for customer loan requests, \\ncustomer deposit maturities and withdrawals, debt service, \\nleases for premises and equipment, and other cash \\ncommitments. Liquidity risk also considers the stability of \\ndeposits, including the risk of losing uninsured or non-\\noperational deposits. The objective of effective liquidity \\nmanagement is to ensure that we can meet our contractual \\nobligations and other cash commitments efficiently under both \\nnormal operating conditions and under periods of Wells Fargo-\\nspecific and/or market stress. \\nTo help achieve this objective, the Board establishes liquidity \\nguidelines that require sufficient asset-based liquidity to cover \\npotential funding requirements and to avoid over-dependence \\non volatile, less reliable funding markets.

For \\nadditional information on liquidity risk and funding management, \\nsee the ‚ÄúRisk Management ‚Äì Liquidity Risk and Funding‚Äù section \\nin our 2022  Form 10-K.\\nLiquidity Standards   We are subject to a rule issued by the FRB, \\nOCC and FDIC that establishes a quantitative minimum liquidity \\nrequirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) \\nestablished by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \\n(BCBS). The rule requires a covered banking organization to hold \\nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) in an amount equal to or \\ngreater than its projected net cash outflows during a 30-day \\nstress period. Our HQLA under the rule predominantly consists \\nof central bank deposits, government debt securities, and \\nmortgage-backed securities of federal agencies. The LCR applies \\nto the Company and to our insured depository institutions (IDIs) \\nwith total assets of $10 billion or more. In addition, rules issued \\nby the FRB impose enhanced liquidity risk management \\nstandards on large bank holding companies (BHCs), such as \\nWells\\xa0Fargo.We are also subject to a rule issued by the FRB, OCC and \\nFDIC that establishes a stable funding requirement, known as the \\nnet stable funding ratio (NSFR), which requires a covered banking \\norganization, such as Wells Fargo, to maintain a minimum \\namount of stable funding, including common equity, long-term \\ndebt and most types of deposits, in relation to its assets, \\nderivative exposures and commitments over a one-year horizon \\nperiod. The NSFR applies to the Company and to our IDIs with \\ntotal assets of $10\\xa0billion or more.

These assets make up our primary \\nsources of liquidity. Our primary sources of liquidity are \\nsubstantially the same in composition as HQLA under the LCR \\nrule; however, our primary sources of liquidity will generally exceed HQLA calculated under the LCR rule due to the applicable \\nhaircuts to HQLA and the exclusion of excess HQLA at our \\nsubsidiary IDIs required under the LCR rule.

Our objective is to maintain capital at an \\namount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance \\nobjectives, and to meet both regulatory and market \\nexpectations. We primarily fund our capital needs through the \\nretention of earnings net of both dividends and share \\nrepurchases, as well as through the issuance of preferred stock \\nand long- and short-term debt. Retained earnings at \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 , increased  $11.3\\xa0billion  from December\\xa031, \\n2022 , predominantly  as a result of $15.7 billion  of Wells\\xa0Fargo \\nnet income, partially offset by $4.4 billion  of common and \\npreferred stock dividends. During the first nine months of 2023 , \\nwe issued $1.0\\xa0billion  of common stock, substantially all of which \\nwas issued in connection with employee compensation and \\nbenefits. In the first nine months of 2023 , we repurchased \\n220\\xa0million  shares of common stock at a cost of $9.6 billion .

Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \\nratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below.\\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS   The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \\nimplement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \\norganizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted  assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on an assessment of the proposed \\nrule. The Company is considering a range of potential actions to \\naddress the impact of the proposed rule, including balance sheet \\nand capital optimization strategies.\\nTable 31  and Table 32  present the risk-based capital \\nrequirements applicable to the Company under the Standardized \\nApproach and Advanced Approach, respectively, as of \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 .Table 31:   Risk-Based Capital Requirements ‚Äì Standardized Approach\\nStandardized Approach\\n9.20%\\n10.70%\\n12.70%4.50%\\n6.00%\\n8.00%3.20%\\n3.20%\\n3.20%1.50%\\n1.50%\\n1.50%\\nMinimum requirement Stress capital buffer\\nG-SIB capital surchargeCommon Equity Tier 1 \\n(CET1) ratio\\nTier 1 capital ratio\\nTotal capital ratio\\nTable 32:   Risk-Based Capital Requirements ‚Äì Advanced Approach\\nAdvanced Approach\\n8.50%\\n10.00%\\n12.00%4.50%\\n6.00%\\n8.00%2.50%\\n2.50%\\n2.50%1.50%\\n1.50%\\n1.50%\\nMinimum requirement Capital conservation buffer\\nG-SIB capital surchargeCommon Equity Tier 1 \\n(CET1) ratio\\nTier 1 capital ratio\\nTotal capital ratio\\nIn addition to the risk-based capital requirements described \\nin Table 31  and Table 32 , if the FRB determines that a period of \\nexcessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic \\nrisk, a countercyclical buffer of up to 2.50% could be added to the \\nrisk-based capital ratio requirements under federal banking \\nregulations.

Our long-term targeted capital \\nstructure also considers capital levels sufficient to exceed capital \\nrequirements, including the G-SIB capital surcharge and the \\nstress capital buffer, as well as potential changes to regulatory \\nrequirements for our capital ratios, planned capital actions, \\nchanges in our risk profile and other factors. Accordingly, our \\nlong-term target capital levels are set above their respective \\nregulatory minimums plus buffers.\\nThe FRB capital plan rule establishes capital planning and \\nother requirements that govern capital distributions, including \\ndividends and share repurchases, by certain BHCs, including \\nWells\\xa0Fargo. The FRB assesses, among other things, the overall \\nfinancial condition, risk profile, and capital adequacy of BHCs \\nwhen evaluating their capital plans.\\nAs part of the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and \\nReview, the FRB generates a supervisory stress test. The FRB \\nreviews the supervisory stress test results as required under the \\nDodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all \\nlarge BHCs and also reviews the Company‚Äôs proposed capital \\nactions .\\nFederal banking regulators also require large BHCs and \\nbanks to conduct their own stress tests to evaluate whether the \\ninstitution has sufficient capital to continue to operate during \\nperiods of adverse economic and financial conditions.Capital Management (continued)\\n50 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Under the proportional amortization method, tax credit investments are carried at \\namortized cost and amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and income tax benefits received. \\nThe amortization of the investment and the related income tax credits and income tax benefits are \\nrecorded in income tax expense. The Update may be adopted on either a full retrospective or modified \\nretrospective basis and early adoption is permitted.\\nUpon adoption of the Update, we will identify our tax credit programs and make a separate accounting \\npolicy election as to whether to apply the proportional amortization method for each program.

Wells\\xa0Fargo & Company (the \\nParent) is a financial holding company and a bank holding \\ncompany.  We also hold a majority interest in a real estate \\ninvestment trust, which has publicly traded preferred stock \\noutstanding.\\nOur accounting and reporting policies conform with U.S. \\ngenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and practices in \\nthe financial services industry. For discussion of our significant \\naccounting policies, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant \\nAccounting Policies) in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the \\nyear ended December 31, 2022 (2022 Form 10-K). There were \\nno material changes to these policies in the first nine months of \\n2023 .\\nTo prepare the financial statements in conformity with \\nGAAP, management must make estimates based on \\nassumptions about future economic and market conditions (for \\nexample, unemployment, market liquidity, real estate prices, etc.) \\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the \\ndate of the financial statements, income and expenses during the \\nreporting period and the related disclosures. Although our \\nestimates contemplate current conditions and how we expect \\nthem to change in the future, it is reasonably possible that actual \\nconditions could be worse than anticipated in those estimates, \\nwhich could materially affect our results of operations and \\nfinancial condition.

The new required \\ndisclosures include information about modifications granted to \\nborrowers experiencing financial difficulty in the form of principal \\nforgiveness, interest rate reductions, other-than-insignificant \\npayment delays, term extensions, or a combination of these \\nmodifications. The ASU also requires new disclosures for the \\nfinancial effects of these modifications and for loan performance \\nin the twelve months following the modification. The Update also \\namends the guidance for vintage disclosures to require disclosure \\nof current period gross charge-offs by year of origination. See \\nNote 5  (Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses ) for \\nadditional information related to the new disclosures for loan \\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty and \\nfor gross charge-offs by year of origination, which are provided \\non a prospective basis.\\nThe Update eliminates the requirement to use a discounted \\ncash flow (DCF) approach to measure the allowance for credit \\nlosses (ACL) for TDRs and instead allows for the use of a current \\nexpected credit loss approach for all loans. Under a current \\nexpected credit loss approach, the impact of loan modifications \\nand the subsequent performance of modified loans, including \\ndefaults, is reflected in the historical loss data used to calculate \\nexpected lifetime credit losses. Upon adoption on January 1, \\n2023, we discontinued utilizing a DCF approach to measure \\ncredit impairment for consumer loans and certain commercial \\nloans previously modified in a TDR and we removed the interest \\nconcession component recognized in the ACL. We elected to \\napply the modified-retrospective transition approach method, \\nresulting in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings \\nupon adoption, which reflects the difference between the pre-\\nmodification and post-modification effective interest rates that \\nwould have been recognized over the remaining life of the loans \\nas interest income. Upon adoption, we recognized a decrease in \\nour ACL of $429 million , pre-tax, and an increase to our retained \\nearnings of $323 million , after tax. We continue to use a DCF \\napproach for certain non-accruing, non-collateral dependent \\ncommercial loans.Notes to Financial Statements \\n64 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Update also provides guidance on the accounting for \\nhedged item basis adjustments under the portfolio layer method.\\nWe adopted ASU 2022-01 on January 1, 2023 on a \\nprospective basis. No cumulative effect adjustment to the \\nopening balance of stockholders‚Äô equity was required upon \\nadoption, as impacts to us were reflected prospectively. The \\nportfolio layer method improves our ability to use derivatives to \\nhedge interest rate risk exposures associated with portfolios of \\nfinancial assets, such as fixed-rate available-for-sale (AFS) debt \\nsecurities and loans. The Update allows us to hedge a larger \\nproportion of these portfolios by expanding the number and type \\nof derivatives permitted as eligible hedges, as well as by \\nincreasing the scope of eligible hedged items to include both \\nprepayable and nonprepayable assets. Unlike other fair value \\nhedging relationships where basis adjustments adjust the \\ncarrying amount of the individual hedged item, basis adjustments \\nrelated to active portfolio layer method hedges are maintained at \\na portfolio level and not allocated to the individual assets in the \\nportfolio.\\nUpon adoption, any election to designate portfolio layer \\nmethod hedges is applied prospectively. Additionally, the Update \\npermits a one-time reclassification of debt securities from held-\\nto-maturity (HTM) to AFS classification as long as the securities \\nare designated in a portfolio layer method hedge no later than 30 \\ndays after the adoption date.\\nIn January 2023, we reclassified fixed-rate debt securities \\nwith an aggregate fair value of $23.2 billion  and amortized cost \\nof $23.9 billion  from HTM to AFS and designated interest rate \\nswaps with notional amounts of $20.1 billion  as fair value hedges \\nusing the portfolio layer method. The transfer of debt securities \\nwas recorded at fair value and resulted in approximately \\n$566\\xa0million  of unrealized losses associated with AFS debt \\nsecurities being recorded to other comprehensive income, net of \\ndeferred taxes. \\nSee Note 3  (Available-for-Sale and Held-to-Maturity Debt \\nSecurities ) for additional information about the Company's \\nportfolio layer method hedge basis adjustments and HTM to AFS \\ntransfers in connection with adoption of the Update and Note 11  \\n(Derivatives ) for disclosures regarding our portfolio layer method \\nhedging relationships.  \\nASU 2021-08 amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) \\n805 ‚Äì Business Combinations to require entities to recognize and \\nmeasure contract assets and contract liabilities in a business \\ncombination in accordance with ASC 606 ‚Äì Revenue Recognition. \\nPrior to ASU 2021-08, there was diversity in practice related to \\nrecognition treatment, and acquirers generally measured such \\nitems at acquisition date fair value. We adopted this Update \\nprospectively on January 1, 2023. This Update did not have a \\nmaterial impact to our consolidated financial statements. ASU 2018-12  changes the accounting for long-duration \\ninsurance contracts or contract features that provide benefits to \\nthe policyholder in addition to the policyholder‚Äôs account value. \\nThese features, which the ASU defines as market risk benefits, \\nprotect the policyholder to some degree from capital markets \\nrisk and expose the insurer or reinsurer to that risk. The ASU \\nrequires all market risk benefits to be measured at fair value \\nthrough earnings with changes in fair value attributable to our \\nown credit risk recognized in other comprehensive income. We \\nreinsure certain variable annuity products for a limited number of \\ninsurance clients with guaranteed minimum benefits which are \\naccounted for as market risk benefits under the ASU. Our \\nreinsurance business is no longer entering into new contracts.\\nWe utilize a discounted cash flow model to value our market \\nrisk benefits. Market risk benefits are level 3 fair value liabilities \\nbecause they are valued using significant unobservable inputs. \\nThe fair value of our market risk benefits is sensitive to changes \\nin fixed income and equity markets, as well as policyholder \\nbehavior (e.g., withdrawals, lapses, utilization rate) and changes in \\nmortality assumptions. Beginning first quarter 2023, we use \\nderivative instruments, where feasible, to economically hedge \\nthe interest rate and equity markets volatility. The fair value of \\nmarket risk benefits is measured at the contract level and is \\nrecognized in accrued expenses and other liabilities. We \\nrecognize changes in fair value for our market risk benefits, \\nexcluding the change in fair value related to our own credit risk, in \\nnoninterest income along with the changes in fair value of \\neconomic hedges. Changes in fair value attributable to our own \\ncredit risk are recorded in other comprehensive income. Upon \\nadoption on January 1, 2023, as required under the ASU, we \\nimplemented the accounting changes for market risk benefits \\nretrospectively, to the earliest period presented, which resulted \\nin an after-tax cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained \\nearnings and accumulated other comprehensive income by \\n$176\\xa0million  and $44\\xa0million , respectively, as of January 1, 2022.\\nThe ASU also requires more frequent updates for insurance \\nassumptions, mandates the use of a standardized discount rate \\nfor traditional long-duration contracts, and simplifies the \\namortization of deferred acquisition costs. The accounting \\nchanges for the liability of future policyholder benefits for \\ntraditional long-duration contracts (included in accrued expenses \\nand other liabilities) and deferred acquisition costs (included in \\nother assets) did not have a material impact upon adoption.\\nTable 1.1  presents the impact of adoption to prior period \\nfinancial statement line items within our consolidated statement \\nof income and consolidated balance sheet for the three and nine  \\nmonths ended September\\xa030, 2022 , and as of December 31, \\n2022.

The credit quality \\nindicators that we most closely monitor include credit ratings \\nand delinquency status and are based on information as of our \\nfinancial statement date. \\nCREDIT RATINGS  Credit ratings express opinions about the credit \\nquality of a debt security. We determine the credit rating of a \\nsecurity according to the lowest credit rating made available by \\nnational recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). \\nDebt securities rated investment grade, that is those with ratings \\nsimilar to BBB-/Baa3 or above, as defined by NRSROs, are \\ngenerally considered by the rating agencies and market participants to be low credit risk. Conversely, debt securities \\nrated below investment grade, labeled as ‚Äúspeculative grade‚Äù by \\nthe rating agencies, are considered to be distinctively higher \\ncredit risk than investment grade debt securities. For debt \\nsecurities not rated by NRSROs, we determine an internal credit \\ngrade of the debt securities (used for credit risk management \\npurposes) equivalent to the credit ratings assigned by major \\ncredit agencies. Substantially all  of our debt securities were rated \\nby NRSROs at September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, 2022 . \\nTable 3.4  shows the percentage of fair value of AFS debt \\nsecurities and amortized cost of HTM debt securities determined \\nto be rated investment grade, inclusive of securities rated based \\non internal credit grades.\\nWells Fargo & Company 69', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Loan \\ndelinquency, Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores and loan-\\nto-value (LTV) for residential mortgage loans are the primary \\ncredit quality indicators that we monitor and utilize in our \\nevaluation of the appropriateness of the ACL for the consumer \\nloan portfolio segment. Gross charge-offs by loan class are \\nincluded in the following tables for the nine months ended \\nSeptember 30, 2023 , which we monitor as part of our credit risk \\nmanagement practices; however, charge-offs are not a primary \\ncredit quality indicator for our loan portfolio. \\nMany of our loss estimation techniques used for the ACL for \\nloans rely on delinquency-based models; therefore, delinquency \\nis an important indicator of credit quality in the establishment of \\nour ACL for consumer loans. Credit quality information is \\nprovided with the year of origination for term loans. Revolving \\nloans may convert to term loans as a result of a contractual \\nprovision in the original loan agreement or if modified for a \\nborrower experiencing financial difficulty.\\nWe obtain FICO scores at loan origination and the scores are \\ngenerally updated at least quarterly, except in limited \\ncircumstances, including compliance with the Fair Credit \\nReporting Act (FCRA). FICO scores are not available for certain \\nloan types or may not be required if we deem it unnecessary due \\nto strong collateral and other borrower attributes. Table 5.9  provides the outstanding balances of our \\nresidential mortgage loans by our primary credit quality \\nindicators. \\nLTV refers to the ratio comparing the loan‚Äôs outstanding \\nbalance to the property‚Äôs collateral value. Combined LTV (CLTV) \\nrefers to the combination of first lien mortgage and junior lien \\nmortgage (including unused line amounts for credit line \\nproducts) ratios. We obtain LTVs and CLTVs using a cascade \\napproach which first uses values provided by automated \\nvaluation models (AVMs) for the property. If an AVM is not \\navailable, then the value is estimated using the original appraised \\nvalue adjusted by the change in Home Price Index (HPI) for the \\nproperty location. If an HPI is not available, the original appraised \\nvalue is used. The HPI value is normally the only method \\nconsidered for high value properties, generally with an original \\nvalue of $1 million  or more, as the AVM values have proven less \\naccurate for these properties. Generally, we obtain available LTVs \\nand CLTVs on a quarterly basis. Certain loans do not have an LTV \\nor CLTV due to a lack of industry data availability and portfolios \\nacquired from or serviced by other institutions.Note 5 :  Loans and Related Allowance for Credit Losses  (continued)\\n80 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Commercial \\nloan term extensions have terms that vary based on the \\nborrower‚Äôs request and are evaluated by our credit teams on an \\nindividual basis.\\nOur consumer loan modifications vary based upon the loan \\nproduct and  the modification program offered to the borrower, \\nand may include interest rate reductions, payment delays, term \\nextensions, principal forbearance or forgiveness, or a \\ncombination of these modifications. Generally, our consumer \\nloan modification programs modify the loan terms to achieve \\npayment terms that are more affordable to the borrower and, as \\na result, increase the likelihood of full repayment of principal and \\ninterest. \\nOur residential mortgage loan modification programs may \\noffer a short-term payment deferral based upon the borrower's \\ndemonstrated hardship, up to 12 months. If additional assistance \\nis needed after 12 months, the borrower may request another \\nloan modification. Modifications may also include a trial payment \\nperiod of three months  to determine if the borrower can perform \\nin accordance with the proposed permanent loan modification \\nterms. Loans in a trial payment period continue to advance \\nthrough delinquency status and accrue interest according to their \\noriginal terms. Loans in a trial payment period are excluded from \\nour loan modification disclosures until the borrower has \\nsuccessfully completed the trial period and the loan modification \\nis formally executed. Residential mortgage loans in a trial \\npayment period totaled $115\\xa0million  at September\\xa030, 2023 . Credit card loan modifications result in a reduction in the \\ncredit card interest rate and may be offered on a short-term or \\nlong-term basis. A short-term interest rate reduction program \\nreduces the borrower‚Äôs interest rate for 12 months. A long-term \\ninterest rate reduction program provides a reduction of the \\ninterest rate over a fixed five-year term. During the modification \\nperiod, the borrower‚Äôs revolving charge privileges are revoked.\\nAuto loan modifications generally include insignificant (e.g., \\nthree months or less) payment deferrals over the loan term. \\nThe following disclosures provide information on loan \\nmodifications granted to borrowers experiencing financial \\ndifficulty in the form of principal forgiveness, interest rate \\nreductions, other-than-insignificant (e.g., greater than three \\nmonths) payment delays, term extensions or a combination of \\nthese modifications, as well as the financial effects of these \\nmodifications, and loan performance in the twelve months \\nfollowing the modification. Loans that both modify and are paid \\noff or charged-off during the period, resulting in an amortized \\ncost balance of zero at the end of the period, are not included in \\nthe disclosures below. Additionally, where amortized cost \\nbalances are presented below, accrued interest receivable is \\nexcluded.

The district court granted final \\napproval of the settlement, which was appealed to the United \\nStates Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement \\nobjector merchants.\\xa0Other merchants opted out of the \\nsettlement and are pursuing several individual actions. On \\nJune\\xa030, 2016, the Second Circuit vacated the settlement \\nagreement and reversed and remanded the consolidated action \\nto the United States District Court for the Eastern District of \\nNew York for further proceedings. On November\\xa023,\\xa02016, prior \\nclass counsel filed a petition to the United States Supreme Court, \\nseeking review of the reversal of the settlement by the Second \\nCircuit, and the Supreme Court denied the petition on March 27, \\n2017. On November 30, 2016, the district court appointed lead \\nclass counsel for a damages class and an equitable relief class. \\nThe parties have entered into a settlement agreement to resolve \\nthe damages class claims pursuant to which defendants will pay a \\ntotal of approximately $6.2 billion , which includes approximately \\n$5.3\\xa0billion  of funds remaining from the 2012 settlement and \\n$900 million  in additional funding. The Company‚Äôs allocated \\nresponsibility for the additional funding is approximately \\n$94.5\\xa0million . The court granted final approval of the settlement \\non December 13, 2019, which was appealed to the United States \\nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit by settlement objector \\nmerchants. On March 15, 2023, the Second Circuit affirmed the \\ndamages class settlement. On September 27, 2021, the district \\ncourt granted the plaintiffs‚Äô motion for class certification in the \\nequitable relief case. Several of the opt-out and direct action \\nlitigations have been settled while others remain pending.\\nRECORD-KEEPING INVESTIGATIONS   The SEC and the United \\nStates Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have \\nundertaken investigations regarding the Company‚Äôs compliance \\nwith records retention requirements relating to business \\ncommunications sent over unapproved electronic messaging \\nchannels. In August 2023, the Company entered into agreements \\npursuant to which it paid $125 million  to the SEC and $75 million  \\nto the CFTC in order to resolve their investigations.RMBS TRUSTEE LITIGATION   In December 2014, Phoenix Light SF \\nLimited (Phoenix Light) and certain related entities filed a \\ncomplaint in the United States District Court for the Southern \\nDistrict of New York alleging claims against Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., in its capacity as trustee for a number of residential \\nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) trusts. Complaints raising \\nsimilar allegations have been filed by Commerzbank AG in the \\nSouthern District of New York, IKB International and IKB \\nDeutsche Industriebank (together, IKB) in New York state court, \\nand Park Royal I LLC and Park Royal II LLC in New York state \\ncourt. In each case, the plaintiffs allege that Wells\\xa0Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., as trustee, caused losses to investors, and plaintiffs assert \\ncauses of action based upon, among other things, the trustee‚Äôs \\nalleged failure to notify and enforce repurchase obligations of \\nmortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations \\nand warranties, notify investors of alleged events of default, and \\nabide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events \\nof default. In July\\xa02022, the district court dismissed Phoenix \\nLight‚Äôs claims and certain of the claims asserted by \\nCommerzbank AG, and subsequently entered judgment in each \\ncase in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. In August 2022, Phoenix \\nLight and Commerzbank AG each appealed the district court‚Äôs \\ndecision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \\nCircuit. Phoenix Light dismissed its appeal in May 2023, \\nterminating its case. In October 2023, the Company reached an \\nagreement in principle with IKB to resolve IKB‚Äôs claims. The \\nCompany previously settled two  class actions filed by \\ninstitutional investors and an action filed by the National Credit \\nUnion Administration with similar allegations.\\nSEMINOLE TRIBE TRUSTEE LITIGATION   The Seminole Tribe of \\nFlorida filed a complaint in Florida state court alleging that \\nWells\\xa0Fargo, as trustee, charged excess fees in connection with \\nthe administration of a minor‚Äôs trust and failed to invest the \\nassets of the trust prudently. The complaint was later amended \\nto include three  individual current and former beneficiaries as \\nplaintiffs and to remove the Tribe as a party to the case.\\nOUTLOOK   As described above, the Company establishes accruals \\nfor legal actions when potential losses associated with the \\nactions become probable and the costs can be reasonably \\nestimated. The high end of the range of reasonably possible \\nlosses in excess of the Company‚Äôs accrual for probable and \\nestimable losses was approximately $1.6 billion  as of \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023 . The outcomes of legal actions are \\nunpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties, and it is \\ninherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or \\neven possible. It is also inherently difficult to estimate the \\namount of any loss and there may be matters for which a loss is \\nprobable or reasonably possible but not currently estimable. \\nAccordingly, actual losses may be in excess of the established \\naccrual or the range of reasonably possible loss. Based on \\ninformation currently available, advice of counsel, available \\ninsurance coverage, and established reserves, Wells Fargo \\nbelieves that the eventual outcome of the actions against Wells \\nFargo and/or its subsidiaries will not, individually or in the \\naggregate, have a material adverse effect on Wells Fargo‚Äôs \\nconsolidated financial condition. However, it is possible that the \\nultimate resolution of a matter, if unfavorable, may be material \\nto Wells Fargo‚Äôs results of operations for any particular period.Note 10 :\\xa0 Legal Actions  (continued)\\n96 Wells Fargo & Company', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

We also \\nenter into futures contracts, forward contracts, and swap \\ncontracts to hedge our exposure to the price risk of physical \\ncommodities included in Other Assets. In addition, we use \\ninterest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, cross-currency \\ninterest rate swaps and forward contracts to hedge against \\nchanges in fair value of certain investments in available-for-sale \\n(AFS) debt securities due to changes in interest rates, foreign \\ncurrency rates, or both. For certain fair value hedges of interest \\nrate risk, we use the portfolio layer method to hedge stated \\namounts of closed portfolios of AFS debt securities. For certain \\nfair value hedges of foreign currency risk, changes in fair value of \\ncross-currency swaps attributable to changes in cross-currency \\nbasis spreads are excluded from the assessment of hedge \\neffectiveness and recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). See Note 20  (Other Comprehensive Income ) for the \\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income.\\nFor cash flow hedges, we use interest rate swaps to hedge \\nthe variability in interest payments received on certain interest-\\nearning deposits with banks and certain floating-rate commercial \\nloans. We also use cross-currency swaps to hedge variability in \\ninterest payments on fixed-rate foreign currency-denominated \\nlong-term debt due to changes in foreign exchange rates.\\nWe estimate $976 million  pre-tax of deferred net losses \\nrelated to cash flow hedges in OCI at September\\xa030, 2023 , will be \\nreclassified into net interest income during the next twelve \\nmonths.

SPEs are often formed in connection with securitization \\ntransactions whereby financial assets are transferred to an SPE. \\nSPEs formed in connection with securitization transactions are \\ngenerally considered variable interest entities (VIEs). The VIE \\nmay alter the risk profile of the asset by entering into derivative \\ntransactions or obtaining credit support, and issues various \\nforms of interests in those assets to investors. When we transfer \\nfinancial assets from our consolidated balance sheet to a VIE in \\nconnection with a securitization, we typically receive cash and \\nsometimes other interests in the VIE as proceeds for the assets \\nwe transfer. In certain transactions with VIEs, we may retain the \\nright to service the transferred assets and repurchase the \\ntransferred assets if the outstanding balance of the assets falls \\nbelow the level at which the cost to service the assets exceed the \\nbenefits. In addition, we may purchase the right to service loans \\ntransferred to a VIE by a third party. \\nIn connection with our securitization or other VIE activities, \\nwe have various forms of ongoing involvement with VIEs, which \\nmay include:\\n‚Ä¢ underwriting securities issued by VIEs and subsequently \\nmaking markets in those securities;\\n‚Ä¢ providing credit enhancement on securities issued by VIEs \\nthrough the use of letters of credit or financial guarantees;\\n‚Ä¢ entering into other derivative contracts with VIEs;\\n‚Ä¢ holding senior or subordinated interests in VIEs;\\n‚Ä¢ acting as servicer or investment manager for VIEs; \\n‚Ä¢ providing administrative or trustee services to VIEs; and\\n‚Ä¢ providing seller financing to VIEs.\\nLoan Sales and Securitization Activity\\nWe periodically transfer consumer and commercial loans and \\nother types of financial assets in securitization and whole loan \\nsale transactions. \\nMORTGAGE LOANS SOLD TO U.S. GOVERNMENT SPONSORED \\nENTITIES AND TRANSACTIONS WITH GINNIE MAE  In the normal \\ncourse of business we sell residential and commercial mortgage \\nloans to government-sponsored entities (GSEs). These loans are \\ngenerally transferred into securitizations sponsored by the GSEs, \\nwhich provide certain credit guarantees to investors and \\nservicers. We also transfer mortgage loans into securitization \\npools pursuant to Government National Mortgage Association \\n(GNMA) guidelines which are insured by the Federal Housing \\nAdministration (FHA) or guaranteed by the Department of \\nVeterans Affairs (VA). Mortgage loans eligible for securitization \\nwith the GSEs or GNMA are considered conforming loans. The \\nGSEs or GNMA design the structure of these securitizations, \\nsponsor the involved VIEs, and have power over the activities \\nmost significant to the VIE.\\nWe account for loans transferred in conforming mortgage \\nloan securitization transactions as sales and do not consolidate \\nthe VIEs as we are not the primary beneficiary. In exchange for \\nthe transfer of loans, we typically receive securities issued by the \\nVIEs which we sell to third parties for cash or hold for investment \\npurposes as HTM or AFS securities. We also retain servicing \\nrights on the transferred loans. As a servicer, we retain the option \\nto repurchase loans from certain loan securitizations, which becomes exercisable based on delinquency status such as when \\nthree scheduled loan payments are past due. When we have the \\nunilateral option to repurchase a loan, we recognize the loan and \\na corresponding liability on our balance sheet regardless of our \\nintent to repurchase the loan, and the loans remain pledged to \\nthe securitization. At September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, \\n2022 , we recorded assets and related liabilities of $1.1\\xa0billion  and \\n$743\\xa0million , respectively, where we did not exercise our option \\nto repurchase eligible loans. We repurchased loans of $49\\xa0million  \\nand $240 million , during the third quarter  and first nine months \\nof 2023 , respectively, and $574\\xa0million  and $2.1 billion  during \\nthe third quarter  and first nine months of 2022 , respectively.\\nUpon transfers of loans, we also provide indemnification for \\nlosses incurred due to material breaches of contractual \\nrepresentations and warranties as well as other recourse \\narrangements. At September\\xa030, 2023 , and December\\xa031, 2022 , \\nour liability for these repurchase and recourse arrangements was \\n$185\\xa0million  and $167\\xa0million , respectively, and the maximum \\nexposure to loss was $13.5 billion  and $13.8 billion  at \\nSeptember\\xa030, 2023  and December\\xa031, 2022 , respectively. \\n Substantially all  residential servicing activity is related to \\nassets transferred to  GSE and GNMA securitizations . See Note 6  \\n(Mortgage Banking Activities ) for additional information about \\nresidential and commercial servicing rights, advances and \\nservicing fees. \\nNONCONFORMING MORTGAGE LOAN SECURITIZATIONS   In the \\nnormal course of business, we sell nonconforming mortgage \\nloans in securitization transactions that we design and sponsor. \\nNonconforming mortgage loan securitizations do not involve a \\ngovernment credit guarantee, and accordingly, beneficial interest \\nholders are subject to credit risk of the underlying assets held by \\nthe securitization VIE. We typically originate the transferred \\nloans and account for the transfers as sales. We also typically \\nretain the right to service the loans and may hold other beneficial \\ninterests issued by the VIE, such as debt securities held for \\ninvestment purposes. Our servicing role related to \\nnonconforming commercial mortgage loan securitizations is \\nlimited to primary or master servicer. We do not consolidate the \\nVIE because the most significant decisions impacting the \\nperformance of the VIE are generally made by the special servicer \\nor the controlling class security holder. For our residential \\nnonconforming mortgage loan securitizations accounted for as \\nsales, we either do not hold variable interests that we consider \\npotentially significant or are not the primary servicer for a \\nmajority of the VIE assets.\\nWHOLE LOAN SALE TRANSACTIONS  We may also sell whole loans \\nto VIEs where we have continuing involvement in the form of \\nfinancing. We account for these transfers as sales, and do not \\nconsolidate the VIEs as we do not have the power to direct the \\nmost significant activities of the VIEs.\\nTable 13.1  presents information about transfers of assets during \\nthe periods presented for which we recorded the transfers as \\nsales and have continuing involvement with the transferred \\nassets. In connection with these transfers, we received proceeds \\nand recorded servicing assets and securities. Each of these \\ninterests are initially measured at fair value. Servicing rights are \\nclassified as Level 3 measurements, and generally securities are \\nclassified as Level 2.

In these transactions, we receive cash in exchange \\nfor transferring securities as collateral and recognize an \\nobligation to reacquire the securities for cash at the transaction‚Äôs \\nmaturity. These types of transactions create risks, including \\n(1)\\xa0the counterparty may fail to return the securities at maturity, \\n(2) the fair value of the securities transferred may decline below \\nthe amount of our obligation to reacquire the securities, and \\ntherefore create an obligation for us to pledge additional \\namounts, and (3) the counterparty may accelerate the maturity \\non demand, requiring us to reacquire the security prior to \\ncontractual maturity. We attempt to mitigate these risks in \\nvarious ways. Our collateral primarily  consists of highly liquid \\nsecurities. In addition, we underwrite and monitor the financial \\nstrength of our counterparties, monitor the fair value of \\ncollateral pledged relative to contractually required repurchase \\namounts, and monitor that our collateral is properly returned \\nthrough the clearing and settlement process in advance of our \\ncash repayment.

For \\nadditional information on legal actions, see Note 10  (Legal \\nActions ); \\n‚Ä¢ Customer remediation activities, which are associated with \\nour efforts to identify areas or instances where customers \\nmay have experienced financial harm and provide \\nremediation as appropriate. We have accrued for the \\nprobable and estimable costs related to our customer \\nremediation activities, which amounts may change based on \\nadditional facts and information, as well as ongoing reviews \\nand communications with our regulators; and\\n‚Ä¢ Other business activities such as deposit overdraft losses, \\nfraud losses, and isolated instances of customer redress.\\nTable 17.2  provides the components of our operating losses \\nincluded in our consolidated  statement of income.  \\nTable 17.2:   Operating Losses  \\nQuarter ended \\nSeptember 30,Nine months ended \\nSeptember 30,\\n($ in millions) 2023 2022 2023 2022\\nLegal actions $ 175  984 $ 115  1,097 \\nCustomer remediation  (30)  978  133  1,615 \\nOther  184  256  580  755 \\nTotal operating losses $ 329  2,218 $ 828  3,467 \\nOperating losses may have significant variability given the \\ninherent and unpredictable nature of legal actions and customer \\nremediation activities. The timing and determination of the \\namount of any associated losses for these matters depends on a \\nvariety of factors, some of which are outside of our control.

Under the proposed rule, \\nthe FDIC would collect a special assessment based on a \\ncalculation using an insured depository institution‚Äôs estimated \\namount of uninsured deposits. As currently proposed, the \\namount of our special assessment may be up to $1.8 billion  (pre-\\ntax). We expect to expense the entire amount upon the FDIC‚Äôs \\nfinalization of the rule, which we expect to occur in fourth quarter \\n2023.

Based on assets, we were \\nthe fourth largest bank holding company in the United States. At \\nDecember 31, 2023, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. was the Company‚Äôs \\nprincipal subsidiary with assets of $1.7 trillion, or 90% of the \\nCompany‚Äôs assets. \\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form \\n10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those \\nreports, are available for free at www.wellsfargo.com/about/ \\ninvestor-relations/filings as soon as reasonably practicable after \\nthey are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities \\nand Exchange Commission (SEC).

In addition, we offer \\nfinancial planning, private banking, investment management, and \\nfiduciary services. We also provide financial solutions to \\nbusinesses through products and services including traditional \\ncommercial loans and lines of credit, letters of credit, asset-\\nbased lending and leasing, trade financing, treasury \\nmanagement, and investment banking services. \\nAs of December 31, 2023, we had four reportable operating \\nsegments for management reporting purposes: Consumer \\nBanking and Lending; Commercial Banking; Corporate and \\nInvestment Banking; and Wealth and Investment Management. \\nThe 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders includes financial \\ninformation and descriptions of these operating segments. \\nHuman Capital \\nOur people are what set Wells Fargo apart and are critical to our \\nsuccess. Wells Fargo continues to invest in our employees by \\noffering market competitive compensation, career-development \\nopportunities, a broad array of benefits, and strong work-life \\nprograms. \\n1 We do not control this website.

Wells Fargo's compensation program \\nis linked to performance management and is designed to \\npromote prudent risk management and reinforce its culture and \\noperating standards. The compensation principles include: \\n‚Ä¢ Pay for performance : Compensation is linked to company, \\nline of business, and individual performance, including \\nmeeting regulatory expectations and creating long-term \\nvalue consistent with the interests of shareholders. \\n‚Ä¢ Promote effective risk management : Compensation promotes \\neffective risk management and discourages imprudent or \\nexcessive risk-taking. \\n‚Ä¢ Attract and retain talent : People are one of Wells Fargo's \\ncompetitive advantages; therefore, compensation helps \\nattract, motivate, and retain people with the skills, talent, \\nand experience to drive superior long-term company \\nperformance. \\nIn addition, we provide all eligible full- and part-time employees \\n(and their eligible dependents, as applicable) with a \\ncomprehensive set of benefits designed to protect their physical, \\nemotional, and financial health to help them make the most of \\ntheir well-being. \\nPay Equity Review. Wells Fargo is committed to fair and equitable \\ncompensation practices. We have conducted an annual pay \\nequity review through engagement with a third-party consultant \\nfor a number of years. The pay equity review compares the \\ncompensation of women to men globally and U.S. minorities \\nversus U.S. non-minorities taking into account factors such as \\nrole, level, tenure, and geography. We may make adjustments to \\ncompensation in the event the review identifies gaps. The year-\\nend 2023 review showed that women at Wells Fargo continue to \\nearn more than 99 cents for every $1 earned by their male peers, \\nand U.S. employees that are racially/ethnically diverse earn more \\nthan 99 cents for every $1 earned by their Caucasian/white \\npeers. \\nPromoting Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Meeting the \\nincreasingly diverse needs of Wells Fargo‚Äôs global customer base \\nis critical to our Company‚Äôs long-term growth and success. Wells \\nFargo values and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I) \\nin every aspect of our business. We are dedicated to recruitment \\nand career development practices that support our employees \\nand promote diversity throughout our workforce, including \\nleadership positions. We developed DE&I principles, which are \\ninformed by affirmative action and equal employment \\nopportunity policies, for our Operating Committee.

Our U.S. workforce was 53% Caucasian/white and 47% \\nracially/ethnically diverse. \\nEmployee learning and development. We invest in the \\ndevelopment of our employees and managers. We believe that \\nwhen our employees feel properly supported, engaged, and \\nconfident in their skills, they are more effective and can provide \\nan even better customer experience. During 2023, we invested \\napproximately $200 million in a variety of employee learning and \\ndevelopment programs, including functional training, regulatory \\ncompliance, leadership and professional development, and early \\ntalent development programs. In addition, we provided tuition \\nreimbursement for approximately 2,600 employees in 2023. \\nWork-life programs. Wells Fargo offers many benefits, programs, \\nand work arrangements intended to provide employees with \\nflexibility and work-life balance. For example, employees in \\ncertain non-customer-facing roles have flexibility to work up to \\ntwo days a week remotely, and are expected to spend a minimum \\nof three days a week in the office. Expectations for other roles, \\nincluding customer-facing, operations, contact center, and non-\\nU.S. based employees, vary by business need. \\nCompetition The financial services industry is highly competitive. Our \\nsubsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as \\nbanks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance \\ncompanies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, \\ninvestment banks and mutual fund companies. They also face \\nincreased competition from nonbank institutions such as \\nbrokerage houses, private equity firms and online lending \\ncompanies, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of \\ncommercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these \\ncompetitors enjoy fewer regulatory constraints and some may \\nhave lower cost structures. \\nSecurities firms and insurance companies that elect to \\nbecome financial holding companies may acquire banks and other \\nfinancial institutions. Combinations of this type could \\nsignificantly change the competitive environment in which we \\nconduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to \\nbecome more competitive as further technological advances \\nenable more companies to provide financial services. These \\ntechnological advances may diminish the importance of \\ndepository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the \\ntransfer of funds between parties. \\nREGULATION AND SUPERVISION \\nWe describe below, and in Note 26 (Regulatory Capital \\nRequirements and Other Restrictions) to Financial Statements in \\nthe 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders, the material elements \\nof the regulatory framework applicable to us. Banking statutes, \\nregulations and policies are continually under review by Congress \\nand state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, \\nas well as non-U.S. governments and financial regulators, and a \\nchange in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or \\nimplemented, could have a material effect on our business. The \\nregulatory framework applicable to depository institutions and \\nbank holding companies (BHCs) is intended to protect \\ndepositors, federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank \\nholding companies such as the Company. \\nStatutes, regulations, and policies could restrict our ability to \\ndiversify into other areas of financial services, make acquisitions, \\nand pay dividends on our capital stock. They may also require us \\nto provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary \\nbanks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by \\nmanagement, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a \\nresult of assessments or a general deterioration in the financial \\ncondition of depository institutions. See the ‚ÄúRegulatory \\nMatters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù sections in the 2023 Annual Report \\nto Shareholders for additional information. \\nGeneral Parent Bank Holding Company. As a BHC, the Parent is subject to \\nregulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and \\nsupervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of \\nthe Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The \\nParent is also subject to the disclosure and regulatory \\nrequirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the \\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as \\nadministered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on \\nthe New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject to \\nthe rules of the NYSE for listed companies. \\nSubsidiary Banks. Our subsidiary national banks, and their \\nsubsidiaries, are subject to regulation and examination primarily \\nby the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also \\nby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, \\nthe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and \\nthe Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The non-\\nU.S. branches and representative offices of our subsidiary \\nnational banks are subject to regulation and examination by their \\nrespective financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. \\nNon-U.S. subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be \\nsubject to the laws and regulations of the countries in which they \\nconduct business. \\nNonbank Subsidiaries. Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also \\nsubject to regulation by the FRB and other applicable federal and \\nstate agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to \\nregulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as \\nwell as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the \\nSEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in \\nsome cases, the CFTC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking \\nBoard, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank \\nsubsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the \\nfederal government and/or the various states as well as non-U.S. \\ncountries in which they conduct business or operate. \\nParent Bank Holding Company Activities \\n‚ÄúFinancial in Nature‚Äù Requirement. We became a financial holding \\ncompany effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our \\nstatus as a BHC for purposes of various FRB regulations. As a \\nBHC that has elected to be treated as a financial holding \\ncompany pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with \\nsecurities firms and insurance companies and engage in other \\nactivities that are financial in nature or incidental or \\ncomplementary to activities that are financial in nature. \\n‚ÄúFinancial in nature‚Äù activities include securities underwriting, \\ndealing, and market making; sponsoring mutual funds and \\ninvestment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; \\nmerchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation \\nwith the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be \\nfinancial in nature or incidental to such financial activity. \\n2 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

In addition, the FRB has implemented a final rule \\nunder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \\nProtection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) that also prohibits our ability to \\nmerge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire \\ncontrol of another company if our total resulting consolidated \\nliabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated \\nliabilities of all financial companies. \\nBecause we are a financial holding company, if any of our \\nsubsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community \\nReinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than \\nsatisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to \\nsatisfactory or better, from engaging in new activities or \\nacquiring companies other than BHCs, banks or savings \\nassociations, except that we could engage in new activities, or \\nacquire companies engaged in activities, that are closely related \\nto banking under the BHC Act. CRA performance is also \\nconsidered by regulators in reviewing applications to establish \\nbank branches. In addition, if the FRB finds that the Company or \\nany one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well \\nmanaged, we would be required to enter into an agreement with \\nthe FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management \\nrequirements and which may contain additional limitations or \\nconditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited from \\nengaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in \\nactivities that are not closely related to banking under the BHC \\nAct without prior FRB approval. If we fail to correct any such \\ncondition within a prescribed period, the FRB could order us to \\ndivest our banking subsidiaries or, in the alternative, to cease \\nengaging in activities other than those closely related to banking \\nunder the BHC Act. \\nInterstate Banking . Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and \\nBranching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a BHC may acquire banks in \\nstates other than its home state, subject to any state \\nrequirement that the bank has been organized and operating for \\na minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the \\nrequirement that the BHC not control, prior to or following the \\nproposed acquisition, more than 10% of the total amount of \\ndeposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless \\nthe acquisition is the bank holding company‚Äôs initial entry into \\nthe state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such \\nlesser or greater amount set by the state). The Riegle-Neal Act \\nalso authorizes banks to merge across state lines, subject to the \\nsame deposit limits noted above, thereby creating interstate \\nbranches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish \\nnew branches in other states. \\nRegulatory Approval. In determining whether to approve a \\nproposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will \\nconsider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on \\ncompetition, financial condition, and future prospects including \\ncurrent and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, \\nexperience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and regulations, the convenience and needs \\nof the communities to be served, including the acquiring \\ninstitution‚Äôs record of compliance under the CRA, the \\neffectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money \\nlaundering activities and the risk to the stability of the United \\nStates banking system. \\nDividend Restrictions \\nThe Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its \\nsubsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A significant source of \\nfunds to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and \\nprincipal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent‚Äôs \\nsubsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and \\nregulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent‚Äôs subsidiary \\nbanks and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory \\napproval. Federal banking regulators have the authority to \\nprohibit the Parent‚Äôs subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or \\nunsound practices in conducting their businesses. The payment \\nof dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in \\nquestion, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. \\nSimilarly, as part of their supervisory authority, regulators may \\nlimit or restrict subsidiary capital distributions. The ability of the \\nParent‚Äôs subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is \\ncurrently, and could be further, influenced by bank regulatory \\npolicies and capital requirements. For information about the \\nrestrictions applicable to the Parent‚Äôs subsidiary banks, see \\nNote 26 (Regulatory Capital Requirements and Other \\nRestrictions) to Financial Statements in the 2023 Annual Report \\nto Shareholders. \\nFurthermore, under a Support Agreement dated June 28, \\n2017, as amended and restated on June 26, 2019 (the ‚ÄúSupport \\nAgreement‚Äù), among the Parent, WFC Holdings, LLC, an \\nintermediate holding company and subsidiary of the Parent (the \\n‚ÄúIHC‚Äù), Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Wells \\nFargo Clearing Services, LLC, and certain other subsidiaries of the \\nParent designated from time to time as material entities for \\nresolution planning purposes or identified from time to time as \\nrelated support entities in our resolution plan, the IHC may be \\nrestricted from making dividend payments to the Parent if \\ncertain liquidity and/or capital metrics fall below defined triggers, \\nor if the Parent‚Äôs board of directors authorizes it to file a case \\nunder the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Any such restriction could \\nmaterially and adversely impact the Parent‚Äôs liquidity and its \\nability to satisfy its debt and other obligations, as well as its \\nability to make dividend payments on its common and preferred \\nstock. See the ‚ÄúRegulatory Matters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù sections \\nof the 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders for additional \\ninformation on the Support Agreement. \\nIn addition to these restrictions on the ability of our \\nsubsidiary banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB requires large \\nBHCs, including Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans \\ndescribing planned capital distributions, such as the payment of \\ndividends. Large BHCs, like Wells Fargo, and their insured \\ndepository institutions also must comply with various capital \\nrequirements, including the reforms known as Basel III, as well as \\nrules that establish leverage and supplementary leverage ratio \\nrequirements. We are also subject to the FRB's rule \\nimplementing an additional capital surcharge on those U.S. \\nbanking organizations, such as the Company, that are designated \\nas global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The failure to \\nmeet any of these requirements could result in limitations or \\nrestrictions on our ability to make capital distributions. \\nIn addition, the FRB‚Äôs enhanced supervision regulations for \\nlarge BHCs, like Wells Fargo, impose capital distribution \\nrestrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the \\n3 \", start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

The Parent‚Äôs subsidiary \\nbanks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the \\ntransfer of funds or other assets from such subsidiaries to the \\nParent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-\\ncalled ‚Äúcovered transactions.‚Äù In general, covered transactions \\ninclude loans and other extensions of credit, investments and \\nasset purchases, as well as certain other transactions involving \\nthe transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for \\nthe benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered \\ntransactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited \\nto 10% of the subsidiary bank‚Äôs capital and surplus and, with \\nrespect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the \\naggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank‚Äôs capital and surplus. \\nAlso, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally must be \\nsecured by qualifying collateral. A bank‚Äôs transactions with its \\nnonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm‚Äôs \\nlength terms. The Company is also subject to lending limits and \\nqualitative requirements on loans to executive officers, directors \\nand principal shareholders of the Parent and its subsidiary banks. \\nSource of Strength. The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected \\nto act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of \\nits subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to \\ncommit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This \\nsupport may be required at times when the BHC may not have \\nthe resources to provide the support. \\nThe OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the \\ncapital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become \\nimpaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three \\nmonths, the OCC could order the sale of the Parent‚Äôs stock in the \\nnational bank to cover the deficiency. \\nDepositor Preference. In the event of the ‚Äúliquidation or other \\nresolution‚Äù of an insured depository institution, the claims of \\ndeposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the \\nFDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for \\nadministrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver will have \\npriority over other general unsecured claims against the \\ninstitution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of \\ninsured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the \\nFDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, \\nincluding the Parent, and depositors whose deposits are solely \\npayable at such insured depository institution‚Äôs non-U.S. offices. \\nLiability of Commonly Controlled Institutions. The Company‚Äôs \\nsubsidiaries include banks in the U.S., such as Wells Fargo Bank, \\nN.A., that are insured by the FDIC. Under the Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Act, insured depository institutions can be held liable \\nfor any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by \\nthe FDIC due to the default of an insured depository institution \\ncontrolled by the same BHC, and for any assistance provided by \\nthe FDIC to an insured depository institution that is in danger of \\ndefault and that is controlled by the same BHC. ‚ÄúDefault‚Äù means \\ngenerally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. ‚ÄúIn \\ndanger of default‚Äù means generally the existence of certain \\nconditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the \\nabsence of regulatory assistance. Dodd-Frank Act \\nThe Dodd-Frank Act and the numerous rules to implement its \\nprovisions have resulted in enhanced regulation and supervision \\nof large BHCs, such as Wells Fargo. This includes, among other \\nthings, rules to promote financial stability and prevent or \\nmitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or \\nfailure of a large BHC; enhance consumer protections; prohibit \\nproprietary trading; and implement enhanced prudential \\nrequirements for large BHCs regarding risk-based capital and \\nleverage, risk and liquidity management, stress testing, and \\nrecovery and resolution planning. The Dodd-Frank Act, including \\ncurrent and future rules implementing its provisions and the \\ninterpretation of those rules, has affected, and we expect will \\ncontinue to affect, most of our businesses in some way, either \\ndirectly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly \\nthrough regulation of concentration risks, capital or liquidity. For \\nmore information about the Dodd-Frank Act and its effect on \\nour business, see the ‚ÄúRegulatory Matters‚Äù and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù \\nsections of the 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders. \\nCapital and Liquidity Requirements and Capital Planning \\nThe Company and each of our insured depository institutions are \\nsubject to various regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity \\nrequirements administered by federal banking regulators. The \\ncapital rules, among other things, establish required minimum \\nratios relating capital to different categories of assets and \\nexposures. Federal banking regulators have also imposed a \\nleverage ratio and supplementary leverage ratio on large BHCs, \\nlike Wells Fargo, and their insured depository institutions, as well \\nas a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio. The \\nFRB has also finalized rules to address the amount of equity and \\nunsecured long-term debt a G-SIB must hold to improve its \\nresolvability and resiliency, often referred to as total loss \\nabsorbing capacity. \\nFrom time to time, federal banking regulators propose \\nchanges and amendments to, and issue interpretations of, risk-\\nbased capital requirements and related reporting instructions. In \\naddition, the FRB closely monitors capital levels of the \\ninstitutions it supervises and may require such institutions to \\nmodify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such \\ndeterminations, proposals or interpretations could, if \\nimplemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and \\nnet risk-adjusted assets. \\nAs an additional means to identify problems in the financial \\nmanagement of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit \\nInsurance Act (FDI Act) requires federal banking regulators to \\nestablish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for \\ninstitutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The \\nstandards relate generally to operations and management, asset \\nquality, interest rate exposure, executive compensation and risk \\nmanagement. Federal banking regulators are authorized to take \\naction against institutions that fail to meet such standards. \\nThe FDI Act requires federal banking regulators to take \\n‚Äúprompt corrective action‚Äù with respect to FDIC-insured \\ndepository institutions that do not meet minimum capital \\nrequirements. A depository institution‚Äôs treatment for purposes \\nof the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how \\nits capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain \\nother factors, as established by regulation. \\nIn addition, the FRB‚Äôs capital plan rule establishes capital \\nplanning and other requirements that govern capital \\ndistributions, including dividends and share repurchases, by \\ncertain BHCs, including Wells Fargo. Federal banking regulators \\nalso require stress tests to evaluate whether an institution has \\n4 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an \\ninsurance premium based on an assessment base and an \\nassessment rate. \\nThe FDIC has adopted a comprehensive, long-range plan for \\nDIF management, targeting a designated reserve ratio of 2%. For \\nmore information about our FDIC deposit assessment expense, \\nsee Note 21 (Revenue and Expenses) to Financial Statements in \\nthe 2023 Annual Report to Shareholders. \\nThe FDIC may terminate a depository institution‚Äôs deposit \\ninsurance upon a finding that the institution‚Äôs financial condition \\nis unsafe or unsound or that the institution or its directors have \\nengaged in unsafe or unsound practices or have violated any \\napplicable law, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed \\nby the institution‚Äôs regulatory agency. The termination of deposit \\ninsurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could result in \\na significant loss of deposits and have a material adverse effect \\non our liquidity and earnings, depending on the collective size of \\nthe particular banks involved. \\nFiscal and Monetary Policies \\nOur business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal \\nand monetary policies of the federal government and its \\nagencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of \\nthe FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the \\nUnited States. Among the instruments of monetary policy \\navailable to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations \\nin United States government securities, (b) changing the \\ndiscount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) \\nimposing or changing reserve requirements against depository \\ninstitutions‚Äô deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve \\nrequirements against certain borrowings by banks and their \\naffiliates. These methods are used in varying degrees and \\ncombinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and \\ndeposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid \\non deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect \\non our business, results of operations and financial condition. \\nPrivacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and \\nRestrictions on Affiliate Marketing \\nFederal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-\\nBliley Act (GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of \\nbanks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic \\ninformation about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The \\nrules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in \\nsome circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of \\ncertain personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The \\nprivacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer \\ninformation is transmitted through diversified financial services \\ncompanies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial \\nregulators have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate \\nCredit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the \\nlength of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are \\nprovided to new customers, before information can be shared among different affiliated companies for the purpose of \\nmarketing products and services by those affiliated companies. \\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 \\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented \\na broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures \\ndesigned to increase corporate responsibility, provide for \\nenhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at \\npublicly traded companies, and protect investors by improving \\nthe accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities \\nlaws. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required \\nto file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/ \\nor its implementing regulations established membership \\nrequirements and additional responsibilities for our audit \\ncommittee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us \\nand our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of \\nnon-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed \\nadditional responsibilities for our external financial statements \\non our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded \\nthe disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required \\nour management to evaluate our disclosure controls and \\nprocedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and \\nrequired our independent registered public accounting firm to \\nissue a report on our internal control over financial reporting. \\nUSA PATRIOT Act \\nThe Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing \\nAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism \\nAct of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act) is intended to strengthen the \\nability of U.S. law enforcement agencies and intelligence \\ncommunities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety \\nof fronts. The USA PATRIOT Act has significant implications for \\ndepository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses \\ninvolved in the transfer of money. The USA PATRIOT Act requires \\nthe implementation of policies and procedures relating to \\nanti‚Äëmoney laundering, economic sanctions, suspicious activities, \\nand currency transaction reporting and due diligence on \\ncustomers. The USA PATRIOT Act also requires federal banking \\nregulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in \\ncombating money laundering in determining whether to approve \\na proposed bank acquisition. \\nFuture Legislation or Regulation \\nEconomic, market and political conditions during the past several \\nyears have led to a significant amount of legislation and \\nregulation in the U.S. and abroad affecting the financial services \\nindustry, as well as heightened expectations and scrutiny of \\nfinancial services companies from banking regulators. Further \\nlegislative changes and additional regulations may change our \\noperating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. \\nSuch legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing \\nbusiness, affect our compensation structure, restrict or expand \\nthe activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive \\nbalance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and \\nother financial institutions. We cannot predict whether future \\nlegislative proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect \\nthat they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our \\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition. \\n5 ', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Amounts deferred by a participant were \\ntreated as if invested in the earnings options selected by the \\nparticipant, which determine the deferred compensation benefit \\npayable to the participant. The plan offered a number of earnings \\noptions, including one based on our common stock with \\ndividends reinvested. We generally distribute amounts allocated \\nto the common stock option in shares of common stock. No \\nfuture deferrals may be made under this plan and participants \\nmay no longer reallocate their existing account balances under \\nthe plan among different investment options. Shares remaining \\navailable for issuance under the plan consist of shares issuable as \\na result of amounts credited to participant accounts \\ndenominated in our common stock to reflect cash dividends paid \\non the common stock. The plan is sponsored by a wholly owned \\nsubsidiary, WF Deferred Compensation Holdings, Inc. We have \\nguaranteed its obligations under the plan.
