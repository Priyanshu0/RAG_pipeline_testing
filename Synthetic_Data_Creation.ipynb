The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on a preliminary assessment of the \\nproposed rule.

Risk-based capital rules establish risk-adjusted \\nratios relating regulatory capital to different categories of assets \\nand off-balance sheet exposures as discussed below. \\nRISK-BASED CAPITAL AND RISK-WEIGHTED ASSETS The Company \\nis subject to rules issued by federal banking regulators to \\nimplement Basel III capital requirements for U.S. banking \\norganizations. The rules contain two frameworks for calculating \\ncapital requirements, a Standardized Approach and an Advanced \\nApproach applicable to certain institutions, including Wells Fargo, \\nand we must calculate our risk-based capital ratios under both \\napproaches. The Company is required to satisfy the risk-based \\ncapital ratio requirements to avoid restrictions on capital \\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. \\nOn July 27, 2023, federal banking regulators issued a \\nproposed rule that would impact the way in which risk-based \\ncapital requirements are determined for certain banks. The \\nproposed rule would eliminate the current Advanced Approach \\nand replace it with a new expanded risk-based approach for the \\nmeasurement of risk-weighted assets, including more granular \\nrisk weights for credit risk, a new market risk framework, and a \\nnew standardized approach for measuring operational risk. The \\nnew requirements would be phased in over a three-year period \\nbeginning July 1, 2025. The Company expects a significant \\nincrease in its risk-weighted assets and a net increase in its \\ncapital requirements based on a preliminary assessment of the \\nproposed rule. The Company is considering a range of potential \\nactions to address the impact of the proposed rule, including \\nbalance sheet and capital optimization strategies.   \n",

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This \\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or \\nrisk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the \\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities \\nissued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not \\nconsolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-\\nmaking power with third parties and do not hold significant \\neconomic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making \\nactivities. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe transferred securities of $6.1 billion and $12.6 billion, \\nrespectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained securities of \\n$329 million and $525 million, respectively.

Nonconforming mortgage loan \\nsecuritizations do not involve a government credit guarantee, \\nand accordingly, beneficial interest holders are subject to credit \\nrisk of the underlying assets held by the securitization VIE. We \\ntypically originate the transferred loans and account for the \\ntransfers as sales. We also typically retain the right to service the \\nloans and may hold other beneficial interests issued by the VIEs, \\nsuch as debt securities held for investment purposes. Our \\nservicing role related to nonconforming commercial mortgage \\nloan securitizations is limited to primary or master servicer. We \\ndo not consolidate the VIE because the most significant \\ndecisions impacting the performance of the VIE are generally \\nmade by the special servicer or the controlling class security \\nholder.

RESECURITIZATION ACTIVITIES We enter into resecuritization \\ntransactions as part of our trading activities to accommodate the \\ninvestment and risk management activities of our customers. In \\nresecuritization transactions, we transfer trading debt securities \\nto VIEs in exchange for new beneficial interests that are sold to \\nthird parties at or shortly after securitization settlement. This \\nactivity is performed for customers seeking a specific return or \\nrisk profile. Substantially all of our transactions involve the \\nresecuritization of conforming mortgage-backed securities \\nissued by the GSEs or guaranteed by GNMA. We do not \\nconsolidate the resecuritization VIEs as we share in the decision-\\nmaking power with third parties and do not hold significant \\neconomic interests in the VIEs other than for market-making \\nactivities. During the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, \\nwe transferred securities of $6.1 billion and $12.6 billion, \\nrespectively, to resecuritization VIEs, and retained securities of \\n$329 million and $525 million, respectively. These amounts are \\nnot included in Table 13.1. Related total VIE assets were \\n$111.1 billion and $112.0 billion at June 30, 2023, and \\nDecember 31, 2022, respectively.
